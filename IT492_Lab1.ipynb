            "[\"Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence.Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula.The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz's turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads.Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It's hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors. Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz. Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults.Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things!\", 'This is a very clever animated story that was a big hit, and justifiably so. It had a terrific sequel and if a third film came out, that would probably be a hit, too.When this came out, computer technology just was beginning to strut its stuff. Man, this looked awesome. Now, it\\'s routine because animation, which took a giant leap with this movie, has made a lot more giant strides.The humor in here, however, is what made this so popular. There are tons of funny lines, issued by characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger, among others. As good as Hanks is as \"Woody\" and Allen as \"Buzz Armstrong,\" I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc.Multiple viewings don\\'t diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed \"winner\" as is the sequel.', 'I am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago.The movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy\\'s birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don\\'t want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their \"leader\" because he\\'s the most popular one of them all. He\\'s the only one that hasn\\'t got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other...When you see Toy Story, you may think that the different human like characters (Woody the cowboy for instance) aren\\'t always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. Perhaps that\\'s true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren\\'t yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10.', 'What a wonderful integration of classic toys and a superb plot. It\\'s a new height in animation (though things have gotten even more impressive long since). The voicings of Tim Allen as Buzz and Tom Hanks as Woody, with their inherent connection to their toy beings, with an incredible supporting cast, make this a romp to end all romps. There is a strain between the realities of the world and the fact that even though they are sentient beings, they are still toys. Buzz has lights that flash but he can\\'t really fly. Woody has the ludicrous string on his back that allows him to deliver his catch phrases. Then there is the neighborhood villain, Sid, who is a maimer and destroyer of toys. There is the quest for the mishandled and lost. And a finale that is worthy of everything that has been set up. What really makes this work is the \"humanity\" of the characters. There is love and a true connection among them. If you have never seen this, it is worth every minute.', \"Toy Story – 5/5 starsChildren play with toys. It is a known fact. At one time or another, we all played with toys, whether they were action figures, dolls, little green soldiers, etc\\x85 But what if toys were real? What if they could talk?Pixar and Disney serve us this theory in what was the first full-length computer-animated film ever, 'Toy Story,' chronicling the events in the life of a cowboy doll, Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks).Woody is the favorite toy of his owner, a small child named Andy. Andy brings Woody everywhere, and cherishes him, as we see in the beginning of the film. However, this all changes on Andy's birthday when Andy gets a new toy: a Buzz Lightyear doll (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody is suddenly forgotten, left with the rest of his friends: Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney, better known as Ernest) and Ham (see if you can guess the voice of this one? I'll give you a hint: 'Cheers'). But after Buzz accidentally gets knocked out an upstairs window, Woody is the prime suspect. Now, after Woody and Buzz end up next door, in toy killer Sid's house, Woody must prove his innocence by getting both Buzz and him back to Andy's house safely.'Toy Story' builds on an element we all shrug off carelessly and thoughtlessly. Much like they did last year with monsters under the bed, Pixar took the theory of live toys to a new level in 'Toy Story,' filling our minds with endless possibilities.What Pixar does is a strange thing. It doesn't just try to expand our mind, but also out world. I respect and enjoy that. In 'Monsters, Inc.,' Pixar managed to preach to us 'What if monsters under the bed are real, and what if they have a world much like ours, and have feelings like humans,' while never forgetting the equally important formula of humor. Much is the same with their earlier film 'Toy Story.' What if those wooden and plastic toys we all played with as kids are real? What if they have feelings, emotions, voices, and human qualities? An interesting idea by itself, but when mixed with a wicked sense of humor and reality, you've got yourself one of the best films ever.Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody. Pixar must have modeled the doll's expressions and movements after Hanks, because after a while, I feel like I AM watching Hanks on screen, and NOT a computer-generated image. When you get to the point of not being able to tell animation from reality, you know that the voices are good.The same goes for Tim Allen, though the body gestures were most likely not modeled after Allen's physical expressions (Buzz is a short, pot-bellied toy).The rest of the cast is excellent, all very believable and entertaining. You begin to love each character for their distinguishing traits, and that is always refreshing.I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films. The only film they made that I named forgettable was 'A Bug's Life,' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had.Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. 'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30's-60's: Respect for the audience's intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers. I respect Pixar very much, and after hearing how little Disney does in helping with their films, I feel that Disney is just trying to cash in on their ideas by having their name branded on the posters for Pixar films. Shame on you, Disney. Proof that Disney has no respect for audiences is the fact that they will not let another sequel be made – something that fans like me would rather have than something like 'Finding Nemo.''Toy Story' 1 & 2 are both on my 'favorite films' list. It may sound stupid, but if I made up a top 250 list like IMDb.com, both of those films would be on there; so would 'Monsters Inc.' After an unpromising trailer for Pixar's upcoming film 'Finding Nemo,' I think that after their licensing deal with Disney is disputed (they have to cough up five more ORIGINAL films – not sequels – by 2005), they should definitely try to make a 'Toy Story 3.' I'll be first in line for it, anyway.\", \"Toy Story is a sheer delight to view on the screen.  The characters are well done, the plot is exceptional, and the best thing of all, the film is entirely produced on the computer.  The animation is extraordinary in it's ability to bring such great entertainment to the screen.  The film also teaches some good lessons for the kids like friendship (mainly between Woody and Buzz Light-year).  Spectacular entertainment all around and one of the best films Disney has come with.\", 'This is as close to perfection as any animated film has come, entertained parents on a equal plane with their children, and set the bar to the top of the animation film industry. No film has yet come close to Toy Story in legitimizing animation as a film art on the level of movies with live actors. Great comedies are hard to come by - Toy Story strikes gold on that basis alone, but is so much more. One of the Top 100 Greatest Films of All Time, and currently resides on my \"Top 10 Greatest Comedy Films (1960-Present)\" list.', '\"I believe that a filmmaker\\'s entire work is contained within his first film; not that it can all be foreseen, but that it can afterwards be verified.\" – Francois Truffaut (The Films In My Life) Buzz Lightyear, a glossy action figure with a sexy sheen, is not a mere toy. He\\'s a Space Ranger, tasked with protecting the universe from the evil Emperor Zurg! His life has meaning, he is unique, his existence has grand purpose! Woody, a dated cowboy doll, thinks otherwise. He was once a youthful and exuberant toy, the favourite plaything of his owner Andy, but years of existence have shown him the truth: everyone is just a toy, soon to be forgotten and discarded. No one is unique. There is no grand purpose. No universe to save. Better to be a realist, seeing the world without its fake plastic facade and tacky ipod veneer.Of course Buzz thinks Woody is just a crazy old timer. Doesn\\'t Woody realise that Buzz is a genuine Space Ranger?! That he\\'s a member of the Elite Universe Protection Unit! That he alone has information that reveals Emperor Zurg\\'s weakness! That stupid fool! Naturally, we the audience identify with Woody. Buzz seems like an idiot, brainwashed and in desperate need of identity and purpose. The Elite Universe Protection Unit merely elevates believers into a position of exaggerated importance. This is an idle fantasy, an other-worldly hope adopted by those who can\\'t face the dour reality that is the \"real world of toys\".Midway in the film, our heroes stumble across a horde of green alien toys. These aliens worship a giant claw, a mechanical God which they believe will descend and pluck the \"chosen ones\", taking them to some kind of toy heaven. In reality, the claw chooses only deluded souls, and offers them to the devilish Cid Phillips, a sadistic child who mutilates toys. \"Nirvana is coming!\" the aliens whisper, watching as the \"chosen ones\" are airlifted to their deaths.Buzz Lightyear faces a similar scenario later in the film. Having witnessed a television commercial which advertises a vast range of Buzz Lightyear action figures, Buzz must confront the fact that he really is \"just an ordinary toy\" who \"can not fly\". \"Flying\" thus becomes a sort of Nietzschean metaphor, the ability to transcend the \"flesh\" (in this case, injection moulded plastic) and become \"something more\".Buzz\\'s first reaction upon seeing the commercial is to seek refuge in denial. \"I am not a toy!\" he says to himself, before climbing to the top of a staircase. Seeking to validate himself by flying, by defying the laws of toy-dom, he takes a giant jump – a literal leap of faith – and of course falls promptly to the ground. He can\\'t fly.Cue the fastest existential crisis ever seen in a children\\'s film, Buzz Lightyear promptly falling into a deep depression, his faith completely destroyed. His entire existence was based on a lie, a social framework which indoctrinated him into believing that the fate of the whole universe depended on his actions. How can he continue living? Why do anything? What\\'s the point? And more importantly, how the hell did this become a kid\\'s franchise? It\\'s like a demented cartoon by Philip K. Dick (\"Do Plastic Toys Dream of Suicide Switches?\").Then comes the message of the film. Woody tells Buzz that being a Space Ranger doesn\\'t define who he is. His value, status and worth can only be found within the community of toys, on ground level, and not \"up in the skies\". There is no purpose beyond ground zero and our importance lies solely in our ability to bring good to those immediately around us.Buzz heeds Woody\\'s words and quickly gets over his loss of faith. He stages a daring rescue mission, straps a rocket to his back and flies spectacularly in the air, his newfound love for the \"greater good of his family\" quite literally giving him wings.In true Zarathustran fashion, Buzz becomes a pint sized Ubermensch figure, a superman who reaches for the sky but is then brought depressingly back down to Earth. If he would just lower his sights, Woody then says, Buzz would find enough reasons to live. Set free of the \"moral code\" imprinted on him by his makers, Buzz thus adopts a new code which, though it puts limits upon him, negating some of his wild ambitions and reducing him, in an existential sense, to a chunk of plastic, still allows for a Nietzschean war cry. This cry, which Buzz yells every time he jumps across that dark abyss, sums up humanity best: \"To Infinity and Beyond!\" 8.9/10 – With its revolutionary visuals, consistent humour, genuine sense of adventure, memorable characters, slick camera work and a couple action/adventure scenes worthy of George Lucas, \"Toy Story\" is a milestone in cinema, and one of the most influential animated films since \"Snow White\".Most interesting, though, is in observing how Brad Bird reverses Lasseter\\'s themes here with his first Pixar feature, \"The Incredibles\". Brad Bird seems to be the bad boy of Pixar, subverting them from within. Viva la Resistance. Worth multiple viewings.', 'Y\\'know, I always suspected that my toys were coming to life when I wasn\\'t looking! In Andy\\'s Room, his toys lead lives of noisy desperation come every birthday and Christmas - no one wants to be one-upped by a new addition to the toy box. Nominally led by Cowboy Woody (there\\'s a Brokeback joke in there just waiting to happen), Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Ham the piggybank, Bo Peep, Slinky the dog and a smattering of other playthings go about their toy business of playing checkers, hanging with the hometoys and \"plastic corrosion awareness meetings,\" until Andy\\'s birthday party, when they gather expectantly around a transistor radio, listening to the reports of their toy soldier troops \"in the field\" (downstairs watching Andy\\'s gift-opening), hoping that no gift will be exciting enough to cause Andy to neglect *them.* There is. His name is Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger.Directed by Pixar mainstay John Lasseter, with the voice talents of Tom Hanks (as Woody), Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger (forever Cliff from *Cheers*), R. Lee Ermey, Annie Potts, Jim Varney and Tim Allen (as Buzz), *Toy Story* is that *rara avis* that succeeds on all levels \\x96 in its animation, storyline, character development, its messages of friendship and self-realization and, most importantly, its entertainment value. The fact that this is a cartoon (or animated feature \\x96 just what DO we call this new wave of computer-generated movies?) is incidental. Which makes the slightly dodgy animation (of the \"real people\") irrelevant - it gets the point across with or without the technological finesse.The \"Disney Movie\" has become synonymous with maudlin messages, redneck fundamentalism, anachronistic family values, boneheaded parents, smart-mouthing youngsters, too-hip-to-be-smart teens and insufferable pets. Though Disney\\'s tyrannical umbrella overarches this film\\'s production studio, Pixar Animation, *Toy Story* somehow avoided all trace of Disney\\'s craven hand, which is doubly surprising, considering this is Pixar\\'s first feature length film, after years of experimentation. Right outa the gate and right outa the field.Sure, there are \"messages,\" but they are heartfelt, rather than maudlin (Woody tells Buzz during Buzz\\'s greatest depression that it matters not what Buzz thinks of himself, what makes him important is what his owner, Andy, thinks of him); there are emotional segments, which are truly heartbreaking, rather than cheesy (when Buzz\\'s escape attempt lands him with a broken arm, proving he is Not A Flying Toy, the lyric, \"Clearly I will go sailing no more,\" launches a thousand hankies); and the portrayal of Andy\\'s family was Pixar\\'s triumphal achievement. Boldly contravening Disney\\'s *idée fixe* of the 1950\\'s nuclear family and Norman Rockwell fantasies, one of the many incarnations of a modern-day family is presented: a single mother with two kids, who are neither geniuses nor monsters, just normal children; happy to visit Pizza Planet and disappointed when favorite toys are lost.Buzz \\x96 who believes he is a real life space ranger on a mission to save the universe - become Andy\\'s favorite toy over Woody. The funny thing is: though Buzz believes he is real, he still adheres to toy protocol of \"playing inert\" when humans are in the area. (Maybe it\\'s instinct?) When he mentions saving a toy from Sid, the vicious boy next door, how does he propose to do it if he is to adhere to the inert protocol? Buzz\\'s ingenuousness regarding his role as a toy infuriates Woody to the point of attempted toy-assassination. Through a concatenation of accidents, both he and Buzz become lost and must use teamwork, trust and ingenuity to beat their path back to Andy, which finds them ensconced in scorchingly funny vignettes (Buzz fastening himself in an over-sized seatbelt; both falling in with green, three-eyed aliens; Buzz hyperventilating as \"Mrs. Nesbitt\"). During a climactic rocket ride, the callback line, \"This is not flying - this is falling with style,\" simply seals this movie\\'s greatness.At least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master\\'s infallible toy filing system\\x85.']\n"

              "'[\"Andy\\'s toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy\\'s top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy\\'s new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence.Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula.The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz\\'s turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult\\' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads.Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.

The only film they made that I named forgettable was \\'A Bug\\'s Life,\\' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had.Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. \\'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30\\'s-60\\'s: Respect for the audience\\'s intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers.

The characters are well done, the plot is exceptional, and the best thing of all, the film is entirely produced on the computer.

Spectacular entertainment all around and one of the best films Disney has come with.\", \\'This is as close to perfection as any animated film has come, entertained parents on a equal plane with their children, and set the bar to the top of the animation film industry. No film has yet come close to Toy Story in legitimizing animation as a film art on the level of movies with live actors. Great comedies are hard to come by - Toy Story strikes gold on that basis alone, but is so much more. One of the Top 100 Greatest Films of All Time, and currently resides on my \"Top 10 Greatest Comedy Films (1960-Present)\" list.\\', \\'\"I believe that a filmmaker\\\\\\'s entire work is contained within his first film; not that it can all be foreseen, but that it can afterwards be verified.\" – Francois Truffaut (The Films In My Life) Buzz Lightyear, a glossy action figure with a sexy sheen, is not a mere toy. He\\\\\\'s a Space Ranger, tasked with protecting the universe from the evil Emperor Zurg! His life has meaning, he is unique, his existence has grand purpose! Woody, a dated cowboy doll, thinks otherwise. He was once a youthful and exuberant toy, the favourite plaything of his owner Andy, but years of existence have shown him the truth: everyone is just a toy, soon to be forgotten and discarded. No one is unique. There is no grand purpose. No universe to save. Better to be a realist, seeing the world without its fake plastic facade and tacky ipod veneer.Of course Buzz thinks Woody is just a crazy old timer. Doesn\\\\\\'t Woody realise that Buzz is a genuine Space Ranger?! That he\\\\\\'s a member of the Elite Universe Protection Unit! That he alone has information that reveals Emperor Zurg\\\\\\'s weakness! That stupid fool! Naturally, we the audience identify with Woody. Buzz seems like an idiot, brainwashed and in desperate need of identity and purpose. The Elite Universe Protection Unit merely elevates believers into a position of exaggerated importance. This is an idle fantasy, an other-worldly hope adopted by those who can\\\\\\'t face the dour reality that is the \"real world of toys\".Midway in the film, our heroes stumble across a horde of green alien toys. These aliens worship a giant claw, a mechanical God which they believe will descend and pluck the \"chosen ones\", taking them to some kind of toy heaven. In reality, the claw chooses only deluded souls, and offers them to the devilish Cid Phillips, a sadistic child who mutilates toys. \"Nirvana is coming!\" the aliens whisper, watching as the \"chosen ones\" are airlifted to their deaths.Buzz Lightyear faces a similar scenario later in the film. Having witnessed a television commercial which advertises a vast range of Buzz Lightyear action figures, Buzz must confront the fact that he really is \"just an ordinary toy\" who \"can not fly\". \"Flying\" thus becomes a sort of Nietzschean metaphor, the ability to transcend the \"flesh\" (in this case, injection moulded plastic) and become \"something more\".Buzz\\\\\\'s first reaction upon seeing the commercial is to seek refuge in denial. \"I am not a toy!\" he says to himself, before climbing to the top of a staircase. Seeking to validate himself by flying, by defying the laws of toy-dom, he takes a giant jump – a literal leap of faith – and of course falls promptly to the ground. He can\\\\\\'t fly.Cue the fastest existential crisis ever seen in a children\\\\\\'s film, Buzz Lightyear promptly falling into a deep depression, his faith completely destroyed. His entire existence was based on a lie, a social framework which indoctrinated him into believing that the fate of the whole universe depended on his actions. How can he continue living? Why do anything? What\\\\\\'s the point? And more importantly, how the hell did this become a kid\\\\\\'s franchise? It\\\\\\'s like a demented cartoon by Philip K. Dick (\"Do Plastic Toys Dream of Suicide Switches?\").Then comes the message of the film. Woody tells Buzz that being a Space Ranger doesn\\\\\\'t define who he is. His value, status and worth can only be found within the community of toys, on ground level, and not \"up in the skies\". There is no purpose beyond ground zero and our importance lies solely in our ability to bring good to those immediately around us.Buzz heeds Woody\\\\\\'s words and quickly gets over his loss of faith. He stages a daring rescue mission, straps a rocket to his back and flies spectacularly in the air, his newfound love for the \"greater good of his family\" quite literally giving him wings.In true Zarathustran fashion, Buzz becomes a pint sized Ubermensch figure, a superman who reaches for the sky but is then brought depressingly back down to Earth. If he would just lower his sights, Woody then says, Buzz would find enough reasons to live. Set free of the \"moral code\" imprinted on him by his makers, Buzz thus adopts a new code which, though it puts limits upon him, negating some of his wild ambitions and reducing him, in an existential sense, to a chunk of plastic, still allows for a Nietzschean war cry. This cry, which Buzz yells every time he jumps across that dark abyss, sums up humanity best: \"To Infinity and Beyond!\" 8.9/10 – With its revolutionary visuals, consistent humour, genuine sense of adventure, memorable characters, slick camera work and a couple action/adventure scenes worthy of George Lucas, \"Toy Story\" is a milestone in cinema, and one of the most influential animated films since \"Snow White\".Most interesting, though, is in observing how Brad Bird reverses Lasseter\\\\\\'s themes here with his first Pixar feature, \"The Incredibles\". Brad Bird seems to be the bad boy of Pixar, subverting them from within. Viva la Resistance. Worth multiple viewings.\\', \\'Y\\\\\\'know, I always suspected that my toys were coming to life when I wasn\\\\\\'t looking! In Andy\\\\\\'s Room, his toys lead lives of noisy desperation come every birthday and Christmas - no one wants to be one-upped by a new addition to the toy box. Nominally led by Cowboy Woody (there\\\\\\'s a Brokeback joke in there just waiting to happen), Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Ham the piggybank, Bo Peep, Slinky the dog and a smattering of other playthings go about their toy business of playing checkers, hanging with the hometoys and \"plastic corrosion awareness meetings,\" until Andy\\\\\\'s birthday party, when they gather expectantly around a transistor radio, listening to the reports of their toy soldier troops \"in the field\" (downstairs watching Andy\\\\\\'s gift-opening), hoping that no gift will be exciting enough to cause Andy to neglect *them.* There is. His name is Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger.Directed by Pixar mainstay John Lasseter, with the voice talents of Tom Hanks (as Woody), Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger (forever Cliff from *Cheers*), R. Lee Ermey, Annie Potts, Jim Varney and Tim Allen (as Buzz), *Toy Story* is that *rara avis* that succeeds on all levels \\\\x96 in its animation, storyline, character development, its messages of friendship and self-realization and, most importantly, its entertainment value. The fact that this is a cartoon (or animated feature \\\\x96 just what DO we call this new wave of computer-generated movies?) is incidental. Which makes the slightly dodgy animation (of the \"real people\") irrelevant - it gets the point across with or without the technological finesse.The \"Disney Movie\" has become synonymous with maudlin messages, redneck fundamentalism, anachronistic family values, boneheaded parents, smart-mouthing youngsters, too-hip-to-be-smart teens and insufferable pets. Though Disney\\\\\\'s tyrannical umbrella overarches this film\\\\\\'s production studio, Pixar Animation, *Toy Story* somehow avoided all trace of Disney\\\\\\'s craven hand, which is doubly surprising, considering this is Pixar\\\\\\'s first feature length film, after years of experimentation. Right outa the gate and right outa the field.Sure, there are \"messages,\" but they are heartfelt, rather than maudlin (Woody tells Buzz during Buzz\\\\\\'s greatest depression that it matters not what Buzz thinks of himself, what makes him important is what his owner, Andy, thinks of him); there are emotional segments, which are truly heartbreaking, rather than cheesy (when Buzz\\\\\\'s escape attempt lands him with a broken arm, proving he is Not A Flying Toy, the lyric, \"Clearly I will go sailing no more,\" launches a thousand hankies); and the portrayal of Andy\\\\\\'s family was Pixar\\\\\\'s triumphal achievement. Boldly contravening Disney\\\\\\'s *idée fixe* of the 1950\\\\\\'s nuclear family and Norman Rockwell fantasies, one of the many incarnations of a modern-day family is presented: a single mother with two kids, who are neither geniuses nor monsters, just normal children; happy to visit Pizza Planet and disappointed when favorite toys are lost.Buzz \\\\x96 who believes he is a real life space ranger on a mission to save the universe - become Andy\\\\\\'s favorite toy over Woody. The funny thing is: though Buzz believes he is real, he still adheres to toy protocol of \"playing inert\" when humans are in the area. (Maybe it\\\\\\'s instinct?) When he mentions saving a toy from Sid, the vicious boy next door, how does he propose to do it if he is to adhere to the inert protocol? Buzz\\\\\\'s ingenuousness regarding his role as a toy infuriates Woody to the point of attempted toy-assassination. Through a concatenation of accidents, both he and Buzz become lost and must use teamwork, trust and ingenuity to beat their path back to Andy, which finds them ensconced in scorchingly funny vignettes (Buzz fastening himself in an over-sized seatbelt; both falling in with green, three-eyed aliens; Buzz hyperventilating as \"Mrs. Nesbitt\"). During a climactic rocket ride, the callback line, \"This is not flying - this is falling with style,\" simply seals this movie\\\\\\'s greatness.At least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master\\\\\\'s infallible toy filing system\\\\x85.\\']'"

              "'[\"Andy\\'s toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy\\'s top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy\\'s new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence.Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula.The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz\\'s turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult\\' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads.Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It\\'s hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.

It may sound stupid, but if I made up a top 250 list like IMDb.com, both of those films would be on there; so would \\'Monsters Inc.\\' After an unpromising trailer for Pixar\\'s upcoming film \\'Finding Nemo,\\' I think that after their licensing deal with Disney is disputed (they have to cough up five more ORIGINAL films – not sequels – by 2005), they should definitely try to make a \\'Toy Story 3.\\' I\\'ll be first in line for it, anyway.\", \"Toy Story is a sheer delight to view on the screen.  The characters are well done, the plot is exceptional, and the best thing of all, the film is entirely produced on the computer.  The animation is extraordinary in it\\'s ability to bring such great entertainment to the screen.  The film also teaches some good lessons for the kids like friendship (mainly between Woody and Buzz Light-year).  Spectacular entertainment all around and one of the best films Disney has come with.\", \\'This is as close to perfection as any animated film has come, entertained parents on a equal plane with their children, and set the bar to the top of the animation film industry. No film has yet come close to Toy Story in legitimizing animation as a film art on the level of movies with live actors. Great comedies are hard to come by - Toy Story strikes gold on that basis alone, but is so much more. One of the Top 100 Greatest Films of All Time, and currently resides on my \"Top 10 Greatest Comedy Films (1960-Present)\" list.\\', \\'\"I believe that a filmmaker\\'s entire work is contained within his first film; not that it can all be foreseen, but that it can afterwards be verified.\" – Francois Truffaut (The Films In My Life) Buzz Lightyear, a glossy action figure with a sexy sheen, is not a mere toy. He\\'s a Space Ranger, tasked with protecting the universe from the evil Emperor Zurg! His life has meaning, he is unique, his existence has grand purpose! Woody, a dated cowboy doll, thinks otherwise. He was once a youthful and exuberant toy, the favourite plaything of his owner Andy, but years of existence have shown him the truth: everyone is just a toy, soon to be forgotten and discarded. No one is unique. There is no grand purpose. No universe to save. Better to be a realist, seeing the world without its fake plastic facade and tacky ipod veneer.Of course Buzz thinks Woody is just a crazy old timer. Doesn\\'t Woody realise that Buzz is a genuine Space Ranger?! That he\\'s a member of the Elite Universe Protection Unit! That he alone has information that reveals Emperor Zurg\\'s weakness! That stupid fool! Naturally, we the audience identify with Woody. Buzz seems like an idiot, brainwashed and in desperate need of identity and purpose. The Elite Universe Protection Unit merely elevates believers into a position of exaggerated importance. This is an idle fantasy, an other-worldly hope adopted by those who can\\'t face the dour reality that is the \"real world of toys\".Midway in the film, our heroes stumble across a horde of green alien toys. These aliens worship a giant claw, a mechanical God which they believe will descend and pluck the \"chosen ones\", taking them to some kind of toy heaven. In reality, the claw chooses only deluded souls, and offers them to the devilish Cid Phillips, a sadistic child who mutilates toys. \"Nirvana is coming!\" the aliens whisper, watching as the \"chosen ones\" are airlifted to their deaths.Buzz Lightyear faces a similar scenario later in the film. Having witnessed a television commercial which advertises a vast range of Buzz Lightyear action figures, Buzz must confront the fact that he really is \"just an ordinary toy\" who \"can not fly\". \"Flying\" thus becomes a sort of Nietzschean metaphor, the ability to transcend the \"flesh\" (in this case, injection moulded plastic) and become \"something more\".Buzz\\'s first reaction upon seeing the commercial is to seek refuge in denial. \"I am not a toy!\" he says to himself, before climbing to the top of a staircase. Seeking to validate himself by flying, by defying the laws of toy-dom, he takes a giant jump – a literal leap of faith – and of course falls promptly to the ground. He can\\'t fly.Cue the fastest existential crisis ever seen in a children\\'s film, Buzz Lightyear promptly falling into a deep depression, his faith completely destroyed. His entire existence was based on a lie, a social framework which indoctrinated him into believing that the fate of the whole universe depended on his actions. How can he continue living? Why do anything? What\\'s the point? And more importantly, how the hell did this become a kid\\'s franchise? It\\'s like a demented cartoon by Philip K. Dick (\"Do Plastic Toys Dream of Suicide Switches?\").Then comes the message of the film. Woody tells Buzz that being a Space Ranger doesn\\'t define who he is. His value, status and worth can only be found within the community of toys, on ground level, and not \"up in the skies\". There is no purpose beyond ground zero and our importance lies solely in our ability to bring good to those immediately around us.Buzz heeds Woody\\'s words and quickly gets over his loss of faith. He stages a daring rescue mission, straps a rocket to his back and flies spectacularly in the air, his newfound love for the \"greater good of his family\" quite literally giving him wings.In true Zarathustran fashion, Buzz becomes a pint sized Ubermensch figure, a superman who reaches for the sky but is then brought depressingly back down to Earth. If he would just lower his sights, Woody then says, Buzz would find enough reasons to live. Set free of the \"moral code\" imprinted on him by his makers, Buzz thus adopts a new code which, though it puts limits upon him, negating some of his wild ambitions and reducing him, in an existential sense, to a chunk of plastic, still allows for a Nietzschean war cry. This cry, which Buzz yells every time he jumps across that dark abyss, sums up humanity best: \"To Infinity and Beyond!\" 8.9/10 – With its revolutionary visuals, consistent humour, genuine sense of adventure, memorable characters, slick camera work and a couple action/adventure scenes worthy of George Lucas, \"Toy Story\" is a milestone in cinema, and one of the most influential animated films since \"Snow White\".Most interesting, though, is in observing how Brad Bird reverses Lasseter\\'s themes here with his first Pixar feature, \"The Incredibles\". Brad Bird seems to be the bad boy of Pixar, subverting them from within. Viva la Resistance. Worth multiple viewings.\\', \\'Y\\'know, I always suspected that my toys were coming to life when I wasn\\'t looking! In Andy\\'s Room, his toys lead lives of noisy desperation come every birthday and Christmas - no one wants to be one-upped by a new addition to the toy box. Nominally led by Cowboy Woody (there\\'s a Brokeback joke in there just waiting to happen), Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Ham the piggybank, Bo Peep, Slinky the dog and a smattering of other playthings go about their toy business of playing checkers, hanging with the hometoys and \"plastic corrosion awareness meetings,\" until Andy\\'s birthday party, when they gather expectantly around a transistor radio, listening to the reports of their toy soldier troops \"in the field\" (downstairs watching Andy\\'s gift-opening), hoping that no gift will be exciting enough to cause Andy to neglect *them.* There is. His name is Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger.Directed by Pixar mainstay John Lasseter, with the voice talents of Tom Hanks (as Woody), Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger (forever Cliff from *Cheers*), R. Lee Ermey, Annie Potts, Jim Varney and Tim Allen (as Buzz), *Toy Story* is that *rara avis* that succeeds on all levels x96 in its animation, storyline, character development, its messages of friendship and self-realization and, most importantly, its entertainment value. The fact that this is a cartoon (or animated feature x96 just what DO we call this new wave of computer-generated movies?) is incidental. Which makes the slightly dodgy animation (of the \"real people\") irrelevant - it gets the point across with or without the technological finesse.The \"Disney Movie\" has become synonymous with maudlin messages, redneck fundamentalism, anachronistic family values, boneheaded parents, smart-mouthing youngsters, too-hip-to-be-smart teens and insufferable pets. Though Disney\\'s tyrannical umbrella overarches this film\\'s production studio, Pixar Animation, *Toy Story* somehow avoided all trace of Disney\\'s craven hand, which is doubly surprising, considering this is Pixar\\'s first feature length film, after years of experimentation. Right outa the gate and right outa the field.Sure, there are \"messages,\" but they are heartfelt, rather than maudlin (Woody tells Buzz during Buzz\\'s greatest depression that it matters not what Buzz thinks of himself, what makes him important is what his owner, Andy, thinks of him); there are emotional segments, which are truly heartbreaking, rather than cheesy (when Buzz\\'s escape attempt lands him with a broken arm, proving he is Not A Flying Toy, the lyric, \"Clearly I will go sailing no more,\" launches a thousand hankies); and the portrayal of Andy\\'s family was Pixar\\'s triumphal achievement. Boldly contravening Disney\\'s *idée fixe* of the 1950\\'s nuclear family and Norman Rockwell fantasies, one of the many incarnations of a modern-day family is presented: a single mother with two kids, who are neither geniuses nor monsters, just normal children; happy to visit Pizza Planet and disappointed when favorite toys are lost.Buzz x96 who believes he is a real life space ranger on a mission to save the universe - become Andy\\'s favorite toy over Woody. The funny thing is: though Buzz believes he is real, he still adheres to toy protocol of \"playing inert\" when humans are in the area. (Maybe it\\'s instinct?) When he mentions saving a toy from Sid, the vicious boy next door, how does he propose to do it if he is to adhere to the inert protocol? Buzz\\'s ingenuousness regarding his role as a toy infuriates Woody to the point of attempted toy-assassination. Through a concatenation of accidents, both he and Buzz become lost and must use teamwork, trust and ingenuity to beat their path back to Andy, which finds them ensconced in scorchingly funny vignettes (Buzz fastening himself in an over-sized seatbelt; both falling in with green, three-eyed aliens; Buzz hyperventilating as \"Mrs. Nesbitt\"). During a climactic rocket ride, the callback line, \"This is not flying - this is falling with style,\" simply seals this movie\\'s greatness.At least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master\\'s infallible toy filing systemx85.\\']'"

            "> This cry, which Buzz yells every time he jumps across that dark abyss, sums up humanity best: \"To Infinity and Beyond!\" 3376 3403\n",
            "> 8.9/10 – With its revolutionary visuals, consistent humour, genuine sense of adventure, memorable characters, slick camera work and a couple action/adventure scenes worthy of George Lucas, \"Toy Story\" is a milestone in cinema, and one of the most influential animated films since \"Snow White\". 3403 3459\n",

            "> Though Disney\\'s tyrannical umbrella overarches this film\\'s production studio, Pixar Animation, *Toy Story* somehow avoided all trace of Disney\\'s craven hand, which is doubly surprising, considering this is Pixar\\'s first feature length film, after years of experimentation. 3888 3937\n",
            "> Right outa the gate and right outa the field. 3937 3947\n",
            "> Sure, there are \"messages,\" but they are heartfelt, rather than maudlin (Woody tells Buzz during Buzz\\'s greatest depression that it matters not what Buzz thinks of himself, what makes him important is what his owner, Andy, thinks of him); there are emotional segments, which are truly heartbreaking, rather than cheesy (when Buzz\\'s escape attempt lands him with a broken arm, proving he is Not A Flying Toy, the lyric, \"Clearly I will go sailing no more,\" launches a thousand hankies); and the portrayal of Andy\\'s family was Pixar\\'s triumphal achievement. 3947 4064\n",
            "> Boldly contravening Disney\\'s *idée fixe* of the 1950\\'s nuclear family and Norman Rockwell fantasies, one of the many incarnations of a modern-day family is presented: a single mother with two kids, who are neither geniuses nor monsters, just normal children; happy to visit Pizza Planet and disappointed when favorite toys are lost. 4064 4128\n",
            "> Buzz \\x96 who believes he is a real life space ranger on a mission to save the universe - become Andy\\'s favorite toy over Woody. 4128 4155\n",
            "> The funny thing is: though Buzz believes he is real, he still adheres to toy protocol of \"playing inert\" when humans are in the area. 4155 4185\n",
            "> (Maybe it\\'s instinct?) 4185 4192\n",
            "> When he mentions saving a toy from Sid, the vicious boy next door, how does he propose to do it if he is to adhere to the inert protocol? 4192 4224\n",
            "> Buzz\\'s ingenuousness regarding his role as a toy infuriates Woody to the point of attempted toy-assassination. 4224 4244\n",
            "> Through a concatenation of accidents, both he and Buzz become lost and must use teamwork, trust and ingenuity to beat their path back to Andy, which finds them ensconced in scorchingly funny vignettes (Buzz fastening himself in an over-sized seatbelt; both falling in with green, three-eyed aliens; Buzz hyperventilating as \"Mrs. Nesbitt\"). 4244 4311\n",
            "> During a climactic rocket ride, the callback line, \"This is not flying - this is falling with style,\" simply seals this movie\\'s greatness. 4311 4341\n",
            "> At least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master\\'s infallible toy filing system\\x85.'] 4341 4391\n"

              "array(['[\"Andy\\'s toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy\\'s top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy\\'s new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence.Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula.The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz\\'s turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult\\' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads.Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It\\'s hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors. Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz. Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults.Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things!\", \\'This is a very clever animated story that was a big hit, and justifiably so. It had a terrific sequel and if a third film came out, that would probably be a hit, too.When this came out, computer technology just was beginning to strut its stuff. Man, this looked awesome. Now, it\\\\\\'s routine because animation, which took a giant leap with this movie, has made a lot more giant strides.The humor in here, however, is what made this so popular. There are tons of funny lines, issued by characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger, among others. As good as Hanks is as \"Woody\" and Allen as \"Buzz Armstrong,\" I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc.Multiple viewings don\\\\\\'t diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed \"winner\" as is the sequel.\\', \\'I am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago.The movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy\\\\\\'s birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don\\\\\\'t want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their \"leader\" because he\\\\\\'s the most popular one of them all. He\\\\\\'s the only one that hasn\\\\\\'t got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other...When you see Toy Story, you may think that the different human like characters (Woody the cowboy for instance) aren\\\\\\'t always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. Perhaps that\\\\\\'s true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren\\\\\\'t yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10.\\', \\'What a wonderful integration of classic toys and a superb plot. It\\\\\\'s a new height in animation (though things have gotten even more impressive long since). The voicings of Tim Allen as Buzz and Tom Hanks as Woody, with their inherent connection to their toy beings, with an incredible supporting cast, make this a romp to end all romps. There is a strain between the realities of the world and the fact that even though they are sentient beings, they are still toys. Buzz has lights that flash but he can\\\\\\'t really fly. Woody has the ludicrous string on his back that allows him to deliver his catch phrases. Then there is the neighborhood villain, Sid, who is a maimer and destroyer of toys. There is the quest for the mishandled and lost. And a finale that is worthy of everything that has been set up. What really makes this work is the \"humanity\" of the characters. There is love and a true connection among them. If you have never seen this, it is worth every minute.\\', \"Toy Story – 5/5 starsChildren play with toys. It is a known fact. At one time or another, we all played with toys, whether they were action figures, dolls, little green soldiers, etc\\\\x85 But what if toys were real? What if they could talk?Pixar and Disney serve us this theory in what was the first full-length computer-animated film ever, \\'Toy Story,\\' chronicling the events in the life of a cowboy doll, Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks).Woody is the favorite toy of his owner, a small child named Andy. Andy brings Woody everywhere, and cherishes him, as we see in the beginning of the film. However, this all changes on Andy\\'s birthday when Andy gets a new toy: a Buzz Lightyear doll (voiced by Tim Allen). Woody is suddenly forgotten, left with the rest of his friends: Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Rex (Wallace Shawn), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney, better known as Ernest) and Ham (see if you can guess the voice of this one? I\\'ll give you a hint: \\'Cheers\\'). But after Buzz accidentally gets knocked out an upstairs window, Woody is the prime suspect. Now, after Woody and Buzz end up next door, in toy killer Sid\\'s house, Woody must prove his innocence by getting both Buzz and him back to Andy\\'s house safely.\\'Toy Story\\' builds on an element we all shrug off carelessly and thoughtlessly. Much like they did last year with monsters under the bed, Pixar took the theory of live toys to a new level in \\'Toy Story,\\' filling our minds with endless possibilities.What Pixar does is a strange thing. It doesn\\'t just try to expand our mind, but also out world. I respect and enjoy that. In \\'Monsters, Inc.,\\' Pixar managed to preach to us \\'What if monsters under the bed are real, and what if they have a world much like ours, and have feelings like humans,\\' while never forgetting the equally important formula of humor. Much is the same with their earlier film \\'Toy Story.\\' What if those wooden and plastic toys we all played with as kids are real? What if they have feelings, emotions, voices, and human qualities? An interesting idea by itself, but when mixed with a wicked sense of humor and reality, you\\'ve got yourself one of the best films ever.Tom Hanks is perfect as Woody. Pixar must have modeled the doll\\'s expressions and movements after Hanks, because after a while, I feel like I AM watching Hanks on screen, and NOT a computer-generated image. When you get to the point of not being able to tell animation from reality, you know that the voices are good.The same goes for Tim Allen, though the body gestures were most likely not modeled after Allen\\'s physical expressions (Buzz is a short, pot-bellied toy).The rest of the cast is excellent, all very believable and entertaining. You begin to love each character for their distinguishing traits, and that is always refreshing.I can safely say that I have not enjoyed animated films quite so much over the years as I have enjoyed Pixar films. The only film they made that I named forgettable was \\'A Bug\\'s Life,\\' which was in and of it not horrible, but lacking the sense of humor the other Pixar films have and had.Pixar makes very refreshing films. In an era of cheap, made-for-video Disney sequels, rip-off cartoons and television babysitters (i.e. \\'The Jungle Book 2), Pixar holds true to the values that made Disney films so entertaining back in the 30\\'s-60\\'s: Respect for the audience\\'s intelligence, humor, provocative ideas to base the film upon, and respect for the audience (not the exact same thing as the first element), all of which are forgotten in this day and age of money-makers. I respect Pixar very much, and after hearing how little Disney does in helping with their films, I feel that Disney is just trying to cash in on their ideas by having their name branded on the posters for Pixar films. Shame on you, Disney. Proof that Disney has no respect for audiences is the fact that they will not let another sequel be made – something that fans like me would rather have than something like \\'Finding Nemo.\\'\\'Toy Story\\' 1 & 2 are both on my \\'favorite films\\' list. It may sound stupid, but if I made up a top 250 list like IMDb.com, both of those films would be on there; so would \\'Monsters Inc.\\' After an unpromising trailer for Pixar\\'s upcoming film \\'Finding Nemo,\\' I think that after their licensing deal with Disney is disputed (they have to cough up five more ORIGINAL films – not sequels – by 2005), they should definitely try to make a \\'Toy Story 3.\\' I\\'ll be first in line for it, anyway.\", \"Toy Story is a sheer delight to view on the screen.  The characters are well done, the plot is exceptional, and the best thing of all, the film is entirely produced on the computer.  The animation is extraordinary in it\\'s ability to bring such great entertainment to the screen.  The film also teaches some good lessons for the kids like friendship (mainly between Woody and Buzz Light-year).  Spectacular entertainment all around and one of the best films Disney has come with.\", \\'This is as close to perfection as any animated film has come, entertained parents on a equal plane with their children, and set the bar to the top of the animation film industry. No film has yet come close to Toy Story in legitimizing animation as a film art on the level of movies with live actors. Great comedies are hard to come by - Toy Story strikes gold on that basis alone, but is so much more. One of the Top 100 Greatest Films of All Time, and currently resides on my \"Top 10 Greatest Comedy Films (1960-Present)\" list.\\', \\'\"I believe that a filmmaker\\\\\\'s entire work is contained within his first film; not that it can all be foreseen, but that it can afterwards be verified.\" – Francois Truffaut (The Films In My Life) Buzz Lightyear, a glossy action figure with a sexy sheen, is not a mere toy. He\\\\\\'s a Space Ranger, tasked with protecting the universe from the evil Emperor Zurg! His life has meaning, he is unique, his existence has grand purpose! Woody, a dated cowboy doll, thinks otherwise. He was once a youthful and exuberant toy, the favourite plaything of his owner Andy, but years of existence have shown him the truth: everyone is just a toy, soon to be forgotten and discarded. No one is unique. There is no grand purpose. No universe to save. Better to be a realist, seeing the world without its fake plastic facade and tacky ipod veneer.Of course Buzz thinks Woody is just a crazy old timer. Doesn\\\\\\'t Woody realise that Buzz is a genuine Space Ranger?! That he\\\\\\'s a member of the Elite Universe Protection Unit! That he alone has information that reveals Emperor Zurg\\\\\\'s weakness! That stupid fool! Naturally, we the audience identify with Woody. Buzz seems like an idiot, brainwashed and in desperate need of identity and purpose. The Elite Universe Protection Unit merely elevates believers into a position of exaggerated importance. This is an idle fantasy, an other-worldly hope adopted by those who can\\\\\\'t face the dour reality that is the \"real world of toys\".Midway in the film, our heroes stumble across a horde of green alien toys. These aliens worship a giant claw, a mechanical God which they believe will descend and pluck the \"chosen ones\", taking them to some kind of toy heaven. In reality, the claw chooses only deluded souls, and offers them to the devilish Cid Phillips, a sadistic child who mutilates toys. \"Nirvana is coming!\" the aliens whisper, watching as the \"chosen ones\" are airlifted to their deaths.Buzz Lightyear faces a similar scenario later in the film. Having witnessed a television commercial which advertises a vast range of Buzz Lightyear action figures, Buzz must confront the fact that he really is \"just an ordinary toy\" who \"can not fly\". \"Flying\" thus becomes a sort of Nietzschean metaphor, the ability to transcend the \"flesh\" (in this case, injection moulded plastic) and become \"something more\".Buzz\\\\\\'s first reaction upon seeing the commercial is to seek refuge in denial. \"I am not a toy!\" he says to himself, before climbing to the top of a staircase. Seeking to validate himself by flying, by defying the laws of toy-dom, he takes a giant jump – a literal leap of faith – and of course falls promptly to the ground. He can\\\\\\'t fly.Cue the fastest existential crisis ever seen in a children\\\\\\'s film, Buzz Lightyear promptly falling into a deep depression, his faith completely destroyed. His entire existence was based on a lie, a social framework which indoctrinated him into believing that the fate of the whole universe depended on his actions. How can he continue living? Why do anything? What\\\\\\'s the point? And more importantly, how the hell did this become a kid\\\\\\'s franchise? It\\\\\\'s like a demented cartoon by Philip K. Dick (\"Do Plastic Toys Dream of Suicide Switches?\").Then comes the message of the film. Woody tells Buzz that being a Space Ranger doesn\\\\\\'t define who he is. His value, status and worth can only be found within the community of toys, on ground level, and not \"up in the skies\". There is no purpose beyond ground zero and our importance lies solely in our ability to bring good to those immediately around us.Buzz heeds Woody\\\\\\'s words and quickly gets over his loss of faith. He stages a daring rescue mission, straps a rocket to his back and flies spectacularly in the air, his newfound love for the \"greater good of his family\" quite literally giving him wings.In true Zarathustran fashion, Buzz becomes a pint sized Ubermensch figure, a superman who reaches for the sky but is then brought depressingly back down to Earth. If he would just lower his sights, Woody then says, Buzz would find enough reasons to live. Set free of the \"moral code\" imprinted on him by his makers, Buzz thus adopts a new code which, though it puts limits upon him, negating some of his wild ambitions and reducing him, in an existential sense, to a chunk of plastic, still allows for a Nietzschean war cry. This cry, which Buzz yells every time he jumps across that dark abyss, sums up humanity best: \"To Infinity and Beyond!\" 8.9/10 – With its revolutionary visuals, consistent humour, genuine sense of adventure, memorable characters, slick camera work and a couple action/adventure scenes worthy of George Lucas, \"Toy Story\" is a milestone in cinema, and one of the most influential animated films since \"Snow White\".Most interesting, though, is in observing how Brad Bird reverses Lasseter\\\\\\'s themes here with his first Pixar feature, \"The Incredibles\". Brad Bird seems to be the bad boy of Pixar, subverting them from within. Viva la Resistance. Worth multiple viewings.\\', \\'Y\\\\\\'know, I always suspected that my toys were coming to life when I wasn\\\\\\'t looking! In Andy\\\\\\'s Room, his toys lead lives of noisy desperation come every birthday and Christmas - no one wants to be one-upped by a new addition to the toy box. Nominally led by Cowboy Woody (there\\\\\\'s a Brokeback joke in there just waiting to happen), Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Ham the piggybank, Bo Peep, Slinky the dog and a smattering of other playthings go about their toy business of playing checkers, hanging with the hometoys and \"plastic corrosion awareness meetings,\" until Andy\\\\\\'s birthday party, when they gather expectantly around a transistor radio, listening to the reports of their toy soldier troops \"in the field\" (downstairs watching Andy\\\\\\'s gift-opening), hoping that no gift will be exciting enough to cause Andy to neglect *them.* There is. His name is Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger.Directed by Pixar mainstay John Lasseter, with the voice talents of Tom Hanks (as Woody), Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger (forever Cliff from *Cheers*), R. Lee Ermey, Annie Potts, Jim Varney and Tim Allen (as Buzz), *Toy Story* is that *rara avis* that succeeds on all levels \\\\x96 in its animation, storyline, character development, its messages of friendship and self-realization and, most importantly, its entertainment value. The fact that this is a cartoon (or animated feature \\\\x96 just what DO we call this new wave of computer-generated movies?) is incidental. Which makes the slightly dodgy animation (of the \"real people\") irrelevant - it gets the point across with or without the technological finesse.The \"Disney Movie\" has become synonymous with maudlin messages, redneck fundamentalism, anachronistic family values, boneheaded parents, smart-mouthing youngsters, too-hip-to-be-smart teens and insufferable pets. Though Disney\\\\\\'s tyrannical umbrella overarches this film\\\\\\'s production studio, Pixar Animation, *Toy Story* somehow avoided all trace of Disney\\\\\\'s craven hand, which is doubly surprising, considering this is Pixar\\\\\\'s first feature length film, after years of experimentation. Right outa the gate and right outa the field.Sure, there are \"messages,\" but they are heartfelt, rather than maudlin (Woody tells Buzz during Buzz\\\\\\'s greatest depression that it matters not what Buzz thinks of himself, what makes him important is what his owner, Andy, thinks of him); there are emotional segments, which are truly heartbreaking, rather than cheesy (when Buzz\\\\\\'s escape attempt lands him with a broken arm, proving he is Not A Flying Toy, the lyric, \"Clearly I will go sailing no more,\" launches a thousand hankies); and the portrayal of Andy\\\\\\'s family was Pixar\\\\\\'s triumphal achievement. Boldly contravening Disney\\\\\\'s *idée fixe* of the 1950\\\\\\'s nuclear family and Norman Rockwell fantasies, one of the many incarnations of a modern-day family is presented: a single mother with two kids, who are neither geniuses nor monsters, just normal children; happy to visit Pizza Planet and disappointed when favorite toys are lost.Buzz \\\\x96 who believes he is a real life space ranger on a mission to save the universe - become Andy\\\\\\'s favorite toy over Woody. The funny thing is: though Buzz believes he is real, he still adheres to toy protocol of \"playing inert\" when humans are in the area. (Maybe it\\\\\\'s instinct?) When he mentions saving a toy from Sid, the vicious boy next door, how does he propose to do it if he is to adhere to the inert protocol? Buzz\\\\\\'s ingenuousness regarding his role as a toy infuriates Woody to the point of attempted toy-assassination. Through a concatenation of accidents, both he and Buzz become lost and must use teamwork, trust and ingenuity to beat their path back to Andy, which finds them ensconced in scorchingly funny vignettes (Buzz fastening himself in an over-sized seatbelt; both falling in with green, three-eyed aliens; Buzz hyperventilating as \"Mrs. Nesbitt\"). During a climactic rocket ride, the callback line, \"This is not flying - this is falling with style,\" simply seals this movie\\\\\\'s greatness.At least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master\\\\\\'s infallible toy filing system\\\\x85.\\']',\n",
              "       '[\"Among the thousands of films I have viewed, this movie would rank near the top for sheer entertainment. That\\'s not saying it\\'s the best-made or most intelligent or scariest or funniest or features the best effects, etc. etc. But combine all those and you have a film that\\'s tough to beat when you\\'re looking for 100 minutes of escapist fun.The film features some wild computer-enhanced special effects that were new to its day, but now about 10 years later, it\\'s no big deal. In fact, some of it, such as the lion, look pretty hokey compared to the stuff that\\'s out there now. To me, it was story that was the lure, anyway, not the special effects.Because it\\'s so much fun, this is one of the fastest-moving films I\\'ve ever viewed. The time flies by. It\\'s not to be analyzed or given much thought, because it\\'s so ludicrous. You just go along for the wild ride in this fantasy-adventure and get a bunch of laughs and thrills along the way. That\\'s one of the big attractions of this of film: the excellent combination of adventure and comedy.Are there annoying things in this movie? Sure. To me, it was Bonnie Hunt\\'s occult beliefs and too many OMGs and the overdone character of the hunter (Jonathan Hyde). Other than that, I loved the film the first I saw it and every time afterward. I\\'ve probably viewed this movie as much as any, simply because it was so entertaining.Robin Williams, David Alan Grier and the two kids, Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce, were all great people to watch and share this adventure with. Now THIS is entertainment!\", \"The smash hit 1995 film Jumanji- based on the children\\'s book- is a great family film. The plot of the story involves a young boy named Alan Parrish who in the 1960\\'s finds a supernatural board game, that was buried underground in the 1800\\'s. Alan is instantly drawn into playing the game, and Sarah-a girl who lives close to him- also joins in the game. After the powers of the game transport young Alan into the jungles of the board game, no one believes Sarah\\'s story of what happened, and everyone suspects foul play. Now in 1995, a girl named Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and her younger brother Peter have been drawn into the game after finding it in the attic of the old Parrish house. When they play however, Alan (Robin Williams) is released from the jungle accidentally when one of the kids rolls a certain number on the dice. Now, with the powers and creatures of Jumanji released, they must finish the game. But to do so, they must find Sarah (Bonnie Hunt), because now it is her turn to roll the dice. After finding her, they must hurry before the town they live in is destroyed and before they all die!Jumanji is great family film, packed with - at the time - great graphics (that now look like a computer game). While some hate this film for being too terrifying for young children, people have forgotten what the rating PG means-PARENTAL GUIDANCE-NOT all ages. So with this in mind guidance is suggested for scary scenes, but I think any child over 3 can enjoy this film. It has no gore or attacks really. Sure, there\\'re some mildly scary scenes, but look at Harry Potter \\\\x96 I think more kids I heard of thought that was scary than Jumanji. Another great thing about Jumanji, is that like Shrek and such films, adults can enjoy it as well. It\\'s not one of those films where you have to suffer through, like many movies coming out today. I think movies like Jumanji are the best of their kind. The acting was great, and Robin Williams is perfect for the role of Alan Parrish, and Bonnie Hunt and him had good chemistry. Kirsten Dunst in this film was further shaping her acting career, to appear in such films now like \\'Spider-Man\\' and the teen movie \\'Bring It On.\\' I honestly forget the name of the kid who plays Judy\\'s brother Peter, but he was okay. I don\\'t think he was great though. Okay, but not great. I doubt as he gets older he\\'ll get a film career much past his teen years. So if you want some good, family fun seeing a movie, rent Jumanji. And remember, PG = Parental Guidance, not All Ages, so do use discretion is your kids don\\'t like mild terror, but I doubt you\\'ll have to, especially on video (I\\'ll admit the theater added some more terror). It\\'s not as terrifying as Ebert stated in his review. With all the movies he\\'s seen, I think he\\'s way off mark. He compared Jumanji to being as suitable as Jaws was for children, but big news Ebert, Jaws WAS rated PG. Anyway, I hate when people think of Jumanji as a \\'should be PG-13\\' because it\\'s not. It\\'s great family fun with loads of laughs, jungle animals and creatures, and just plain hilariousness! 4/5 stars. I loved Jumanji, and I DEFINITELY recommend it to families.\", \\'I just used to love \"Jumanji\" as a kid. This was what was Oscar worthy to me, because I loved the special effects and Robin Williams. Even though I think I over did it with the Oscar worthy thoughts, still to this day I enjoy \"Jumanji\". It\\\\\\'s a great family film that will make you feel good and have fun with.Robin Williams plays Alan, a boy who when he was little and had a horrible fight with his father plays a game with his friend, Sarah, and the game happens to be cursed causing Alan to get sucked into the game until someone else plays it. Sarah freaking out by just what happened runs home and no one believes her leaving Alan behind for decades in the game. When a new family moves in, Judy and Peter and their Aunt Nora, they find the game and start playing and release Alan who has just survived decades in a jungle. When they realize that they must finish the game to make the horrible curses it brings go away, they find Sarah who is now the town loony, and must play it \\\\\\'til they finish. But can they do that with all the spiders, elephants, lions, tsunami, vines, stampedes, and an angry hunter? You\\\\\\'ll just have to wait and see.This is a great movie for the family and I\\\\\\'d highly recommend it for a good watch. It\\\\\\'s just a fun fill adventure with great effects and some fun performances by Robin and Bonnie and a very young Kirsten Dunst. So sit back, grab the popcorn, and enjoy \"Jumanji\"! 8/10\\', \\'You know the drill: young Alan Parrish gets sucked into a board game called Jumanji, returns when a brother and sister are playing 26 years later, and has to battle the animals that wreak havoc on the town. It all seems pretty simple, but they play some neat tricks with it in the movie. As the adult Alan, Robin Williams is more subdued than usual, but still makes the character admirable. With good support from Bonnie Hunt, Kirsten Dunst, David Alan Grier, Bebe Neuwirth, Jonathan Hyde and Patricia Clarkson, this is a pretty interesting movie. I will admit that the monkeys looked pretty fake, but we can\\\\\\'t dwell on that in this movie; the point is to enjoy oneself while watching it.Oh and one more thing: from \"Jumanji\", I learned the difference between alligators and crocodiles.\\', \\'In Bradford, New Hampshire, in 1969, the bullied boy Alan Parrish overhears drumbeats and finds a boarding game called \"Jumanji\" that was buried one hundred years ago by two boys in the real estate of Alan\\\\\\'s father Sam Parrish (Jonathan Hyde). Alan plays the game with his sweetheart Sarah Whittle and vanishes while Sarah flees from bats that have arrived in his mansion. In the present days, in 1995, Nora Shepherd (Bebe Neuwirth) moves to the abandoned house that belonged to Sam Parrish with her orphan niece Judy Shepherd (Kirsten Dunst) and nephew Peter Shepherd (Bradley Pierce) that lost their parents in a car accident in Canada. They hear the drumbeats, find the Jumanji and decide to play the boarding game. They bring giant mosquitoes, monkeys, a lion and Alan Parrish (Robin Williams) back home twenty-six years older. Soon they discover that they need to finish the game to restore everything the way they were. But the game is too dangerous and brings different threats to them and to Bradford while they play. \"Jumanji\" is a delightful adventure and family entertainment from the 90\\\\\\'s. The story is original and the special effects are still great after twenty years. It is so good to see Robin Williams again and curious to recall Kirsten Dunst still a girl. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"Jumanji\"\\', \"I watched this classic in 2021 for the first time. Trust me, I never felt like old boring stuff. It was truly amazing. Nor, after watching the Jumanji movies till now except for this, did I find this one to be similar. It was different. It was Classical. It was a great show. Fantastical Fantasy. Good adventure although latest ones have lot more. However, this, suprised me considering I had made up my mind of what Jumanji could be. But this was truly amazing. Although latest ones have great cast, next level VFX, astounding adventure, this one\\'s the best. I do love the first part of the latest ones that came in 2017, I\\'d find rather take a tie between the two than selecting one. Thank you. However, lemme tell you, it was leaving Prime, so I watched and it was worth it.\", \"I have not seen this movie in more then a decade perhaps even more so it was pretty new to me again. Sure I remembered a few things here and there but I didn\\'t remember the amount of CGI for a movie made in 1995 or how well the story was.The CGI is of course very dated compared to now but for its time this movie was amazing! The story for a movie that revolves around a board game is a very interesting concept and very well told. The acting by a young Kirsten Dunst and comedic Robin Williams and the rest of the cast is very well done.This is a great movie and if you have children between the ages of 7 to 13 I would bet they\\'d like it too.\", \\'While I try not to take IMDb ratings to heart, I do think the rating for this film is too low. The film is absolutely fantastic in all departments. I will admit, there are some bits that are quite scary due to some scenes that are amazingly dark. The film does start off slowly, but when the film fast forwards to twenty six years later, the film turns into fast-paced family entertainment. Other than one or two scary scenes and the slow beginning, I could find very little wrong with Jumanji. The story is great, very intriguing and filled with humour, scares and poignancy. The cinematography and scenery are constantly breathtaking, and the special effects are extraordinary. The film is aided by a hilarious and poignant script, spirited direction, atmspheric music and the fact that it goes at a very fast pace. Even the acting was great, with Robin Williams in one of his best performances as Alan Parrish. While he is subtle in places, the director allows him to be funny, which is what he does best. Bonnie Hunt is good too and she and Williams have great chemistry, and Bradley Pierce and Kirsten Dunst are cute and lively. Plus the ending is nice and satisfying. All in all, I love this movie, even with its very minor problems, it is non-stop fast paced family entertainment. 9/10 Bethany Cox\\', \\'In 1969, in a small town in New Hampshire, a twelve-year-old boy named Alan Parrish finds a Victorian-era board game called \"Jumanji\", and starts to play it with his friend Sarah. What the children do not realise, however, is that the game has strange, mysterious powers, and when Alan\\\\\\'s token lands on a particular square he is suddenly sucked into the game. Unsurprisingly traumatised by the disappearance of her friend, Sarah runs out of the house shrieking, leaving the game unfinished.Twenty-six years later two more children, Peter and Judy, orphaned by the death of their parents in a car crash, move into the former Parrish family home with their Aunt Nora. They find the old Jumanji set and start playing the game; when Peter rolls a five Alan suddenly reappears, now a grown man. He explains to them that he has been trapped inside the game for the last twenty-six years and that they must now finish the game which he and Sarah started. This, however, is easier said than done. Not only must the children find Sarah and persuade her to take part, they must also cope with the magical effects of the game. Each roll of the dice results in strange happenings in keeping with the game\\\\\\'s jungle adventure theme; animals such as lions, monkeys, elephants and rhinoceroses suddenly materialise and proceed to wreak havoc in the town. Just as deadly is a white hunter named Van Pelt who will take pot-shots at anything that moves, animal or human.The big-name star in this film is Robin Williams, although it also features a young Kirsten Dunst, later to become a big name herself. This isn\\\\\\'t Williams\\\\\\' best role- I generally prefer him in his more serious films like \"Dead Poet\\\\\\'s Society\" or \"Good Morning, Vietnam\"- but it\\\\\\'s a lot better than many of his comedies, which can descend into either silliness or sentimentality.This is the sort of family film that offers something to entertain the adults as well as the children, and has some underlying serious themes. The main theme is that of courage and of confronting one\\\\\\'s fears; the horrors unleashed by the game can (if one is in a particularly serious, analytic frame of mind) be seen as symbolic of the problems that the characters need to overcome. Although (or perhaps because) he is from a wealthy, privileged family, the young Alan is a shy, lonely boy who finds it difficult to make friends and who is neglected by his cold, distant parents. Nevertheless, he does win his father\\\\\\'s approval when he finds the courage to stand up to a gang of bullies who have been tormenting him. There is doubtless some Freudian significance in the fact that Alan\\\\\\'s father and the murderous Van Pelt are played by the same actor.Children, of course, could not care less about Freudian symbolism and are generally allergic to underlying serious themes. When I was a child the one thing that would kill a book or a film stone dead for me was the suspicion that it was being used by the adult world to preach some morally improving message to me. (C.S. Lewis was a particular bête noire of mine after an intellectually precocious classmate, who even at the age of nine cherished the long-term ambition to become Archbishop of Canterbury, pointed out to me the Christian allegory behind the \"Narnia\" stories).Fortunately, any moralising in \"Jumanji\" is fairly light, and I suspect that children will simply see it as an exciting adventure story, even if the final twist in the tale involves the intellectually difficult concept of \"alternative timelines\". The special effects used to create the scenes of the rampaging animals seem to have aroused some excitement when the film first came out, although thirteen years on they have a rather retro, nineties feel to them. (And from the point of view of today\\\\\\'s techno-literate youngsters the 1990s probably seem only slightly less technologically backward than the 1890s). 7/10\\']',\n",
              "       '[\\'Sequels are rarely half as good as the original film. Matthau and Lennon would prove this at the tale end of their film partnership with THE ODD COUPLE PART II. But it has happened. ANOTHER THIN MAN is as good a film as THE THIN MAN. Vincent Minelli\\\\\\'s follow up to FATHER OF THE BRIDE may lack the satire of weddings the original had, but FATHER\\\\\\'S LITTLE DIVIDEND is well made and entertaining in it\\\\\\'s own right. And then there is this film. Of the first movie, GRUMPY OLD MEN, I have made a comment elsewhere. GRUMPIER OLD MEN is a neat follow-up, as we find how Max Goldman (Matthau) finds his new mate, Maria Ragetti (Sophia Loren). It also settles the future of Max\\\\\\'s son Mayor Jacob Goldman (Kevin Pollak) and John Gustafson\\\\\\'s (Lemmon\\\\\\'s) daughter Melanie (Darryl Hannah), and gives a bitter-sweet farewell to John\\\\\\'s father (Burgess Meredith).I think the reason the sequel works is that there is a sense of time and continuity here that is not usually found. In GRUMPY OLD MEN, the reactions of Lemmon and Matthau to the death of their close friend Chuck (Ossie Davis), who had only recently been their rival for Ariel (Ann-Margaret) showed them to be human beings - not just two good comic actors trading insults for yucks. Here, it is watching the final scenes of Grandpa Gustafson (ironically Burgess Meredith\\\\\\'s final role - and a fittingly good one for that fine actor). In the first film Meredith was always acting like a wild authority figure: over ninety years old, but threatening to tan the hides of the middle aged Matthau and Lennon like they were still kids when he stops them fighting. Here we see him in several guises. He is a loving grandpa - he is seen telling Allie (Katie Sagona) the story of Goldilock and the Three Bears (with his own modern interpolations), and then singing \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" to put her to sleep. He is vulgar, but in a loving, sensible way. When Allie swallows a quarter, he suggests that it is normal - all kids swallow or try to swallow coins - and one only should worry if the kid excretes two dimes and nickel. He loves sexual encounters (in the first film he suggests that if Lemmon and Matthau can\\\\\\'t get Arial he can!). Here he meets somebody to romance (Anne Gilbert), and they have a nice time together. But it is a brief one. Having reached 95, God finally comes for Grandpa, and his death manages to bring the other characters from cross purpose quarrels to sanity. It also brings the sweet image of Gilbert depositing a rose over the spot that Grandpa\\\\\\'s ashes are scattered.The continuity theme is also in the portion about \"Catfish Hunter\" the local lake legendary catfish. Grandpa tells John, at one point, that the catfish was old when he was a boy (which begs the question, why did they name the catfish after a major Yankee baseball player of the 1970 teams? - long after Grandpa\\\\\\'s youth). The locals all hope to catch the fish and mount it on their walls. We see it at one point jumping late at night, alone, into the air and back into the late in the glorious moonlight - the monarch of the lake. But at the end, when the catfish is caught by Matthau and Lemmon together, Lemmon (probably influenced by Ann-Margaret, who did the same thing in the first film) gets Matthau to agree to return the catfish to the lake, where it can join Grandpa\\\\\\'s ashes. So the legend is returned to it\\\\\\'s base.Even in the final moments of the film, with another marriage and a joke reminiscent of the first film\\\\\\'s conclusion, suggests continuity. So there is a type of structural vigor in the two films, that strengthens their stories and increases the viewers pleasure watching them. Yes indeed, this is one sequel that works very well.\\', \"If you watched Grumpy Old Men and know the ending there, you can\\'t imagine how these two curmudgeonly old geezers could get a feud going again, especially after what Walter Matthau did for Jack Lemmon when Lemmon was really down. And in point of fact the boys seem to lose a step or two from the first film.Still Grumpier Old Men finds Lemmon and Matthau in their superbly timed best just fighting for sillier reasons. In the first film the rivalry heated up a bit because the two were panting hot and heavy for Ann-Margret and Lemmon got her. Now it\\'s Matthau pursuing and what an object of pursuit he has in Sophia Loren. In the first film Ossie Davis owned a bait shop where everyone bought bait, but also liked to hang around, just like a barbershop. Davis dies during that film and now we find out that Sophia and her aunt Ann Morgan-Guilbert have taken it over and want to make it an Italian restaurant on the lake. Well when the senior citizens of this small Minnesota town hear about this they\\'re up in arms. Fishing is close to a religion there and Matthau is leading the charge. That interferes more with romance than anything else.And the Holy Grail of that religion is none other than the largest catfish known to humankind, the legendary Catfish Hunter. Returning as Lemmon\\'s father is Burgess Meredith who has been on the quest for most of his 95 years. When Lemmon\\'s daughter Darryl Hannah finally ties the knot with Matthau\\'s son you won\\'t believe what\\'s going on with our two leads on the wedding day of their kids.Grumpier Old Men was the farewell performance of Burgess Meredith ending a career that spanned six decades. The man was close to perfection in his performance as the oldest of the old geezers in Grumpier Old Men. This is man who has lived so long he really doesn\\'t feel the need to be subtle and discreet. His courtship of Ann Morgan- Guilbert is a combination of geezer and caveman.Grumpier Old Men, keeping the Lemmon-Matthau standard of comedy high.\", \\'\"Grumpier Old Men\" is the equally funny sequel to \"Grumpy Old Men\". Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau return as John and Max, the longtime neighbors who in this movie have reconciled their friendship. Ann-Margret is back as Ariel, John\\\\\\'s new wife. So is Burgess Meredith as Lemmon\\\\\\'s horny dad, and also returning are Daryl Hannah and Kevin Pollak as Lemmon\\\\\\'s daughter and Matthau\\\\\\'s son who are now engaged to each other and their fathers help them out to plan their wedding with some bizarre ideas. But the real scene stealer in \"Grumpier Old Men\" is the wonderful Sophia Loren as the new Italian woman in Wabasha, Minnesota. Loren plans to turn the grumpy old men\\\\\\'s beloved bait shop into a \\\\\\'ristorante\\\\\\' as she puts it. The grumps don\\\\\\'t like that one bit and try to drive her out of town, but ends up falling for Matthau. It\\\\\\'s great to see Loren get an opportunity to do comedy, and she gets her share of big laughs throughout the film. This film and it\\\\\\'s predecessor once again will remind you of what a great team Lemmon and Matthau made. ***1/2 (out of four)\\', \\'Some people see this as an inferior sequel to the first movie \"Grumpy Old Men\". I don\\\\\\'t agree, i love the first one but i think this one is every bit as good and in some ways..even better than the original. Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are my favorite comedy team. The Fortune Cookie is a classic and i also love \"Buddy Buddy\" and \"The Odd Couple Parts 1 and 2 but the Grumpies hold a special place in my heart. I was personally hoping for another Grumpy movie but sadly we\\\\\\'ve lost both of these wonderful stars so that will never happen.

As for the rest, it\\\\\\'s pretty much what you got in the first film...though with an emphasis on a new character (Sophia Loren) and the upcoming nuptials of two other characters (John\\\\\\'s daughter and Max\\\\\\'s son).The story picks up some time after the first film. John is married to Ariel and he and his nemesis, Max, are getting along better. Much of this might be because their kids are getting serious and talking marriage. Plus they have something else to unite them in the story...their hatred of a new lady, Maria (Loren). Why? Well, she bought their old bait shop and is turning it into a restaurant....and the pair do a lot to try to sabotage the place. These scenes are pretty funny. However, later, Max and Maria start dating....and the kids have a breakup. What\\\\\\'s next? See the film.This is a cute and enjoyable film. Nothing life-changing or super original but still fun and occasionally funny.

It\\'s nice to see that black women had a movie about them, and thanks to the star power of Whitney Houston it became no.1 and was a big hit.  I am actually tired of reading little comments saying that Whitney isn\\'t that good of an actress because all of those comments are based on the fact that she\\'s a singer.  If she wasn\\'t a famous singer, nobody would say anything bad about her acting. IMO, she acted very well just like in all her movies, she\\'s not an oscar caliber actress (very few are) but she definitely has screen presence, charisma and gets the job done.  Stop hating her because she\\'s a singer, unlike Madonna or Mariah, Whitney at least did some quality work with some quality people, and she hasn\\'t had flops & horrible movies.\", \\'I read some of the other comments comcerning this movie. And personally i thought that this movie was greatly misinterpreted. This movie (while have some \"man-bashing\" elements) is more about the friendship of four strong real black women who represent a little part of most women in society. I love this movie. I think that it has humor, depth, and presents a very real perspective on love and dating in today\\\\\\'s world. And while men might take offense to the representation of the male gender in this movie, I think that it\\\\\\'s important to realize that unfaithful, self-absorbed men do exist. However, as we must acknowledge the less moral men of our society, this movie also portrays that good decent men are not a figment of our imagination. With Wesley Snipes and Gregory Hines characters, we see that men are not all callous unfeeling creatures. So basically, I feel that this movie is one to be appreciated and enjoyed. (And in response to one respone that i read. . . One does not CHOOSE who they fall in love with, love just happens. We cannot choose who we love.) Anyways. . .i loved the part where she burned all the clothes too :)\\', \\'I got an opportunity to see Waiting To Exhale for the second time recently, the first time shortly after it came out, and now now. I can\\\\\\'t say time has improved my thoughts of the film, which is odd, as I seemed to recall really enjoying this the first time it came out. (Maybe I should watch \\\\\\'Homeward Bound\\\\\\' again, as I LOVED that movie the first time I saw it) The only actress really to impress in this movie is of course the amazing Angela Bassett who growls and hisses every chance she gets! I really liked this character, and I felt for the trials she was going through. The other character I liked was the one played by Loretta Devine, who was cute as the overweight mother who unexpectedly falls in love. I kind of thought the Lela Rachon character was underwritten, and seemed to almost revel in her wantonness. lol. As for Miss Houston, when I was watching her \"act\", well, Chesty Morgan\\\\\\'s performance in \"Deadly Weapons\" came to mind for some odd reason, as it appears the acting thing was becoming a struggle, and wasn\\\\\\'t going to last for too long.. All in all, I wasn\\\\\\'t really disappointed in the film, it just slid off...\\', \\'WAITING TO EXHALE Waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and waiting... you get the point. \"Waiting To Exhale\", Forrest Whitaker\\\\\\'s take on Terry McMillan\\\\\\'s popular book, had a rather popular following upon it\\\\\\'s release in 1995. It was packaged brilliantly, crossing over into the popular music scene with a blockbuster soundtrack featuring it\\\\\\'s star Whitney Houston. However, as Leonard Maltin said it so beautifully, this film ultimately reminds one too much of the easy listening jazz that plays under nearly every scene.\"Waiting To Exhale\" had the potential to be an interesting movie. It features a nice ensemble that manages to have good chemistry while also allowing certain performers to step into the limelight and really dominate certain scenes. Unfortunately, in the end, the movie is a repetitive drone.It tells the story of four African-American females (played by Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Divine, and Lela Rochon) as they struggle to find the men in life that can satisfy there needs. The only problem, in the world of this movie, men are nothing but complete ass-holes who wouldn\\\\\\'t know the word \"feelings\" if they looked it up in the dictionary. How can this film possibly go anywhere when it\\\\\\'s screenwriters has made men so incredibly unredeemable that nothing can change.For the first 45 minutes, the film is slightly enjoyable. However, as it continues on into it\\\\\\'s 2 hour and plus running time... it begins to feel like deja-vu. The women keep putting themselves in identical situations to those they\\\\\\'ve experienced in the past... and as much as they talk about it in slow/sultry voice-overs, they don\\\\\\'t seem to learn squat.It\\\\\\'s like the soundtrack music. Slightly soothing, enjoyable, and easy to digest... but too slow and pointless to listen to for very long. \"Waiting To Exhale\" in the end is nothing more then a boringly pointless film that wastes the potential it had with the cast. Were the film given more of a focal point, and a more distinct narrative line, perhaps it could have been a good film. But everyone on board apparently missed the memo that... films are better when they have a plot and a purpose.... D ...\\', \"While this movie truly is bound to be more appealing to women than men, it is a touching story of four best friends. How they stick together and grow together through life\\'s mistakes, joys, and bad taste in men. I love Angela Bassett and she is outstanding in this movie. The other 3 ladies, Whitney,Lela, and Loretta do great jobs too. This movie is filled with sweet moments, great laughter, and maybe some tears. Just a wonderful movie that shows what friendship is about. I have not read the book, but I have heard many times that the book is better... but hey thats true for almost every book turned movie. So all I know is I love this movie, and every time I watch it, it gives me great pleasure. Not too mention the soundtrack is fabulous! Whitney, Brandy, Babyface,Faith Evans,and Mary J Blige make the music in the film absolutely great.\", \\'I have the video of this movie and it grew on me as time passed. It\\\\\\'s not a great movie but it is enjoyable and as has been pointed out by others, it feels good to see a movie about women of color for a change. However, the movie would not have been watchable without the formidable talents of Angela Bassett and Loretta Devine. I felt that they really were Bernadine and Gloria -- even their smallest gestures were in tune with their characters. I don\\\\\\'t have the words to describe what fine actors these ladies are and their skills are right up there with Debra Winger, Holly Hunter, Alfre Woodard and others.Gloria seemed to be the only moral woman in the lot. She was adorable as an overweight, insecure no-nonsense business woman and mother. She didn\\\\\\'t think she was worthy of love because of her weight, but she was the only one who found it (and deserved it). She was the only one who didn\\\\\\'t sleep around, wasn\\\\\\'t a man basher, set a good example for her son, and gave good advice to her girlfriends. The other three could learn a lot from her. Loretta Devine has a really beautiful face -- look past the weight and for those of you who judge people by such things, her skin color. She has wonderfully expressive eyes and attractive features. I think it was noteworthy that Gregory Hines\\\\\\' character saw her real beauty and responded to it. His character was a decent, good man and I\\\\\\'m glad this was addressed in the movie.Angela Bassett has always been one of my favorite actors. She is the total package --- beauty and talent. Her character wasn\\\\\\'t perfect but Bernadine did take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life. She was so much better off without that reprehensible excuse for a husband in her life - she could now start her catering business, she had a possible new love in her future and she had good friends that would always be there for her. I was as happy for her as if I were really one of her girlfriends when things turned out well for her in the end.Lela Rochon didn\\\\\\'t display any acting talent here and wasn\\\\\\'t quite up to the job of conveying Robin\\\\\\'s vulnerability and immaturity. She was little more than a tearaway that slept around and made dumb choices. In the book, you realized that Robin had a lot of love to give a man and didn\\\\\\'t seem to know how to choose a good one to bestow it on. She was obviously beautiful and decently educated but she lacked common sense and had never really gotten over her betrayal by a man she had really loved. Her mother was a cancer survivor and her father suffered from advance Alzheimer\\\\\\'s disease. I don\\\\\\'t feel they rounded out this character at all and she didn\\\\\\'t seem like an actual person. Just a cute slut who wondered why she got used by men.Poor Whitney has no acting skills whatsoever! Every character she attempts to portray is exactly the same -- Whitney Houston being well groomed, pretending to be well spoken and classy, and looking cow eyed at whatever male actor she is paired with. Its a shame because Savannah should have been played by someone like Angela Bassett or Kimberly Elise (although she might have been too young). The character had to tell us she was smart -- in a phone conversation with her mother she said \"I\\\\\\'m smart, I\\\\\\'m a good person and I work hard.\" Thank goodness she told us because we sure wouldn\\\\\\'t have known otherwise. She has sex with a man she doesn\\\\\\'t like at all and doesn\\\\\\'t even know well and then has an affair with a married man and calls him scum! She has poor conversational skills, doesn\\\\\\'t really seem interested in her friends\\\\\\'problems and preferred to roll her big eyes and act as if she were so above whatever little difficulties they were going through. Savannah would be such a waste of time for any man unless she took a long hard look at herself. She deserved to be by herself at the end.This movie might have been better with a female director, as Forest Whitaker didn\\\\\\'t \"tell this story\" properly at all. We ended up not liking or caring about the characters because we really didn\\\\\\'t get a strong sense of who they were.Also, was it me, or was everything in this movie either orange or blue?\\', \\'The Feature Film version of the MacMillan Novel was a welcome change from all the \"Hood\" movies that were being released. Unlike the Hood movies \"Exhale\" did not have a plot that revolved around: violence,drugs, and guns. Instead it was a more Upscale drama. If you read the book the roles were cast perfectly with the exception of the woman that played Savannah. Angela Bassett as Bernadine, Lela Rochon as Robin; Loretta Devine as Gloria; could not have been better casted, if the movie were done over a thousand times!Unfortunately Terry MacMillan allowed the project to get too commercial, thus compromising her craft! One verification of this is the exporting of Whitney Houston from the Music Industry to fill the lead as Savannah. The part of Savannah demanded a lot of acting ability. They could\\\\\\'ve gotten Theresa Randall, Robin Givens or Tyra Ferrell to do the lead, but they didn\\\\\\'t. Instead they hired a pop diva in an effort to get millions of her fans into the cineplexes; and of course sing on the Kenny \"Babyface\" Edmonds produced soundtrack! Needless to say the grammy Award winner gave a highly unimpressive performance!As for the directing; now Forest Whittaker\\\\\\'s my boy, but the direction needed a womans touch! The story was supposed to be about feminine friendship, and all the complications that go with it.Despite the box-office success of \"Waiting to Exhale\" it failed to produce a demand for more Upscale Black Dramas! Macmillan had to do it herself in her follow up book turned movie \"How Stella  Got Her Groove Back!\"Read my review of \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\"\\', \"Predictable, full of every soppy sad tragic story you\\'ve seen on the soaps. You know who is going to sleep with whom, you know they shouldn\\'t, you know what the outcome will be. You could write the dialogue yourself, if you\\'ve ever seen even a week\\'s worth of soap operas. You either want to leave the room, or turn the channel, it\\'s so soppy and predictable. Of course they all turn out to be strong women in the end; it was written during that era. Of course 99% of the men are jerks; it was written during that era. Of course all the women are fantastically beautiful; you wouldn\\'t put up with this movie if they looked like real, every-day women. The saddest thing about the movie is how beautiful Whitney Houston used to be before drugs and her husband ruined her.\", \"Vannah is travelling to see her friend Bernie while leaving behind all her old live to start anew.  Bernie has just been left by her husband of 13 years for a white woman.  Robin wants to be loved and happy but always makes the wrong choices.  Glo has an estranged husband and the only man in her life is her teenage son.  The four get together through their struggles in love and live as they try to put it all together again.This is very much a woman\\'s film and, as a man, it\\'s easy for me to criticise it for being a weepy or for being a bit of a woman love \\\\x96in, so I won\\'t.  The plot is pure soap opera, the lives and loves of our 4 women, however it is still involving as the four stories all have strengths as well as weaknesses.  The mix of comedy and sentiment is a bit too much 20:80 and at times the sentiment gets too much, but the sassy characters keep the interest.The soapy sentiment isn\\'t helped by a poor soundtrack and poor use there of. In itself I like some of the love ballad r\\'n\\'b stuff \\\\x96 but here it felt like it was all over every scene.  This really bogs it down. Also a down side is the whole man hating thing \\\\x96 only a few come off looking good.  I thought the director being a man would help redress the balance but it seemed to have no effect.Why \\\\x96 can someone tell me \\\\x96 was Houston chosen to lead this talented black cast?  Was it because she could do a cut price soundtrack?  She\\'s a poor actress and he spoiled her scenes \\\\x96 she needs to stay in TVM\\'s.  Bassett however is powerful as ever and really steals every single scene she\\'s in. Devine adds comedy and sauce while Rochon is perfect as the vulnerable beauty going about love the wrong way.  The male cast is great too \\\\x96 there are so many well known faces in this with only two criticisms of them  1 \\\\x96 everytime I see Haysbert now all I can think of is his 24 character.  And 2 \\\\x96 Wesley Snipes\\' character just don\\'t convince me at all.Overall to criticise this for being girly or sentimental is to miss the point.  It is actually good to see a film with so many good roles for black actresses.  It\\'s a bit too soapy for my taste but it is funny and involving with a commanding Bassett.  Only Huston, a soppy soundtrack and constant man caricatures spoil it.\"]',\n",
              "       '[\"As much as I want to rag this movie, make fun of it, call it all kinds of names, belittle it, mock it and otherwise totally trash it, I can\\'t and that is for one reason: Steve Martin. Mr. Martin saves this movie from cinematic oblivion, allows this movie to survive, function and prosper. He is proof that an actor can save a sorry script, can raise the level of a story, can make a movie watchable. Mr. Martin proves once again that he is arguably the finest comedy actor today. He can take the dumbest line and make it sound brilliant; he can take the most insipid scene and raise it to the level of comedy or drama. Kudos to Steve Martin for his sterling performance. As for the other star, Diane Keaton, her performance is wonderful too, but it is Mr. Martin who carries this movie and once again proves that he is the star.\", \"I enjoyed this film, as I did Father of the Bride (1991), though I had to suspend my credulity a lot. This film was less realistic than the film it was based on, Father\\'s Little Dividend (1951), with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.  For example, it\\'s unlikely that George Banks, a highly successful business owner who obviously must think through his decisions, would be so impetuous as to sell the house he loves and end up having to buy it back at a significant mark-up. (George and Nina decide to sell following a rainstorm that caused their kitchen ceiling to leak, even though the house had two storeys above it.) The new baby *wing* which the Banks then decide to build on to their repurchased home is equally ridiculous, since the house is already huge and only young son Matty is still at home. Between the ill-conceived house sale and repurchase, the posh baby wing and the lavish baby shower, featuring storks flown in from Austria, I don\\'t think George Banks could possibly have spent more money. In the previous film, Father of the Bride (1991), Bryan\\'s parents were portrayed as wealthy, but George is clearly a millionaire himself. I did enjoy this movie -- it\\'s funny, romantic and very warm, with beautiful sets -- but  I would have preferred a little less over-the-top consumerism.\", \\'That is one of my favorite lines, followed by \"and pack up your things and hit the road!  And don\\\\\\'t trample the daisies!\"  Or he says something like that.Anyway.  I went and saw this in theaters and amazingly enough, I really liked it.  One of the best Steve Martin films next to Bowfinger and Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the story and everything else about this movie that made it great.  It wasn\\\\\\'t a comedy going from one zinger to the next but something well thought out and well written.If your looking for a lite movie with some fun, I recommend seeing this movie.\\', \"I have watched this film loads since i have been a child. I love it!!! It\\'s emotional and hilarious!! George and Frank absolutely crack me up but everyone does a great job in their roles. I like number 2 more than number 1 but both great films. A definate must see film!\", \"A sequel to immensely likable Father of the Bride, \\'Father of the Bride Part II\\' is A Well-Done Sequel! Its enjoyable as well as emotional!\\'Father of the Bride Part II\\' Synopsis: George Banks must accept the reality of what his daughter\\'s ascension from daughter to wife, and now, to mother means when placed into perspective against his own stage of life. \\'Father of the Bride Part II\\' is worthy sequel of a wonderful prequel. The characters still appeal, the humor works & the emotional moments are heartfelt as well. Nancy Meyers & Charles Shyer\\'s Screenplay is genuinely well-done. Charles Shyer\\'s Direction, on the other-hand, is good. Cinematography & Editing are fair.Performance-Wise: Steve Martin is lovable. He reprises his part of a loving/possessive dad commendably. Diane Keaton is flawless, yet again. Kimberly Williams-Paisley is cute. George Newbern is sincere. Kieran Culkin is adequate. Martin Short entertains.On the whole, \\'Father of the Bride Part II\\' is a satisfying sequel.\", \"as sequels go,this is film isn\\'t too bad.i didn\\'t think ti was quite as good as the first one,but it\\'s not a bad effort.i didn\\'t find it as funny,and some of Steve Martin\\'s histrionics are old and seem forced a bit too me.really,this one doesn\\'t quite have the same sincerity as the first.through much of this movie,i was all too aware i was watching a movie,whereas with firs tone,i was drawn in,and less aware i was watching a movie with people acting.having said that,there are some bright spots.for,one,this movie is just as touching as the first.and Eugene levy has a great cameo.and there is still some fun to be had.even though this may seem too high a rating after much of what i said above,i still think Father of the Bride II is a 7/10\", \"Mild SPOILERS are contained in the following comments. However, I believe everyone knows the story and how it turns out. The fun of the movie is seeing the actors, especially Martin.Steve Martin is back as George Banks, having just lost his daughter and basketball partner (Kimberly Williams as Annie ) to marriage, and now she is back home with her husband and a big announcement. She is pregnant. Of course everyone is happy, and the joy is doubled when Nina Banks (Diane Keaton as Annie\\'s mom) finds out she is pregnant too. Poor George doesn\\'t know if he can handle all this. After all, he is about to be a grandfather, he\\'s not prepared to be a new father also. Martin Short is back as Franck Eggelhoffer, the unintelligible wedding planner. All ends well as both mom and daughter deliver their babies at the same time, in separate hospital rooms, so George has to go back and forth. The movie ends a few months later, and as Annie and her new baby are leaving, she gives dad a miniature basketball, a reminder to George that he can raise another basketball partner.\", \\'The first \"Father of the Bride\" film made us hold our sides in both laughter and tears, meshing Steve Martin\\\\\\'s great comedic \"Dad\" character with the emotions of marrying off his \"only\" (to that point!) daughter. However, when viewing the sequel to this great film, I was cautious...too often, sequels play for exactly the same type of laughs as the original (think \"Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls\") and thus fail to deliver like their predecessor. Thankfully, \"Father of the Bride II\" does not fall into this trap.With daughter Annie (Kimberly Williams, who ratchets up her acting skills in this film compared to the first) announcing she is pregnant, father George (Martin) grapples with the conflicting emotions of becoming a grandfather. Further complicating things (and adding a bit of hilarity!) is the rather unexpected pregnancy of George\\\\\\'s wife Nina (Diane Keaton). Thus, while coming to terms with his new identity, George also must deal with two pregnant women!Not only is this film filled with comedic genius, though, but it also delivers just as many (if not more) touching emotional moments. Whereas the first film captured George\\\\\\'s equal parts happiness and sadness at seeing his daughter leave, this movie proves to be just as potent regarding George\\\\\\'s identity crisis. With his whole life in flux (the comedic portion of the film), George begins to remember what really matters in the first place: family.Overall, this film is just as good as the original. The combination of genuine emotion and smart (not crude) humor is a welcome balance and counterpoint to other Hollywood fare. Let\\\\\\'s just say that if a \"Grandfather of the Bride\" were in the works, I would be first in line.\\', \"It\\'s a sequel that definitely didn\\'t need to be made, but despite that and some pointlessness that ensues within it- Father of the Bride Part II is an often charming little comedy that still manages to have the genuine heart of its predecessor. From the get go this film largely feels like a bunch of random ideas for a sequel strung together to form a plot. It\\'s a bit messy, formulaic, and even corny at times- but somehow it still manages to be entertaining- and you won\\'t want to stop watching in concern of what may happen next. The acting is about the same as before, Martin and Williams-Paisley often carry the film with their chemistry- and provide for the large heart the film has and honestly make it far more easy to watch. I don\\'t know what it is about the film that I enjoyed so much, but it is bound to leave you smiling. It\\'s not original, or as well done as the first film, but it manages to get in the same spirit and make me laugh quite a bit- and I think that\\'s truly all you can ask to a sequel to a film about a wedding.My Rating: 7/10.\"]',\n",
              "       '[\\'I have very little interest in most action films or violent movies, so I am not the sort of person that would normally watch a film like \"Heat\". However, on a lark and because it\\\\\\'s apparently such a good film I decided to give the film a look. Well, I must say that thought I was not in love with the film it sure was exceptionally well made and had a lot to offer--even for folks like me.The biggest reason I liked the movie and thought it was made so well was its rich and complex plot. At nearly three hours, there is lots and lots of time for the plot to slowly unfold. It also allowed for several concurrent plots to interweave themselves through the film--the story about the master criminals, the cops, another criminal as well as a rogue nut-job that just likes to kill. It\\\\\\'s almost like a mini-series in this respect. I also loved how this was not a set-bound film but was made throughout LA--though I wonder how this was possible, as it must have tied up huge portions of Los Angeles! I also loved some of the characters--particularly Robert De Niro\\\\\\'s oddly professional and scary criminal boss. It was one of his very best performances.There\\\\\\'s very little to complain about in the film, though I thought Al Pacino\\\\\\'s character was a tad over-acted at times. Unlike De Niro, I had a harder time believing Pacino was real. Perhaps it\\\\\\'s just me....Overall, if you don\\\\\\'t mind the violence and the occasionally frenetic pace, then this is a film well wroth seeing. Extremely well-directed and never dull.\\', \\'Heat (1995) is a movie that is in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on Tubi. The storyline follows an underground high end burglary team looking for one big last mission and a parallel story about a successful police officer who is struggling at home. As the buildup to the big heist unfolds the two worlds come closer and closer together until the ultimate collision happens.This movie is directed by Michael Mann (Ali) and stars Robert De Niro (Goodfellas), Al Pacino (Scarface), Val Kilmer (Willow), Jon Voight (Anaconda), Mykelti Williamson (Forest Gump), Ashley Judd (Kiss the Girls), Tom Sizemore (Black Hawk Down), Wes Studi (Deep Rising), Natalie Portman (Leon: The Professional), Ted Levine (Silence of the Lambs) and Dennis Haysbert (Far from Heaven).This cast is absolutely amazing top to bottom. The writing is also excellent and delivers the backstories to each character to perfection and the dialogue is out of this world. The chemistry of the cast throughout the film worked perfectly and the action scenes are intense and very well done. You find yourself rooting for both sides the entire film. The conclusion to such a huge movie is excellent and fits the film perfectly.This is an all time classic that is an absolute must see and an easy 10/10. I would strongly recommend seeing this.\\', \\'I really believe this is one the great crime movies of all time. It has some drawbacks that wouldn\\\\\\'t make me recommend this for family viewing - tons of f- words by Al Pacino and a few bloody scenes, but as far as a fascinating crime story: wow!This movie made modern-day history because it was the first time two of the great actors of this generation - Pacino and Robert De Niro - finally acted together in the same film. Those two didn\\\\\\'t disappoint, either. They were great to watch and one of the huge highlights of the film, to me, was when they faced each other in a simple conversation over a cup of coffee. That conversation has always fascinated me, no matter how many times I\\\\\\'ve heard it. It was such a \"landmark\" scene that It\\\\\\'s even the subject of a short documentary on the special-edition DVD.As with the conversation scene, the shootout segment in the streets of Los Angeles still astounds me no matter how many times I see it. The other action scenes are intense and memorable, too, and the cast in here is deep. This isn\\\\\\'t just Pacino and De Niro. It\\\\\\'s Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Jon Voight, Diana Venora, Natlie Portman, Tom Sizemore, Amy Brenamann, Wes Studi, Ted Levine, Mykelti Williamson, on and on. Put that fabulous cast under Michael Mann, one of the best directors in business, add a great soundtrack and interesting camera-work and you have a great film. At three hours long, it never bores one and at same time, doesn\\\\\\'t overdo the action, either. I read one critic criticize this film because of the time taken to examine the personal lives of the main characters, but you can\\\\\\'t have three hours of nothing but action. The only scene I felt went on a bit too long was the ending chase at the airport, but that\\\\\\'s nitpicking considering the film as a whole.This is just one of those movies where a great cast and director live up to their billing.\\', \"This is a brilliant film. While clocking in at a nearly three-hour running time, there isn\\'t a single wasted scene, it is always entertaining and I think it is very rewatchable too. The cinematography, locations and scenery are superb, and the film\\'s atmosphere and pace are also terrific. The story is plausible and beautifully structured with a breathtaking sequence towards the middle of the film, and there are a lot of memorable quotes. Heat is also brilliantly directed by Michael Mann and the acting of Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino is exemplary. So all in all, brilliant and absolutely worth it. 10/10 Bethany Cox\", \\'A brilliant character driven action thriller with drama and emotion all the way. Despite the long runtime, the pacing never drags. The Magic of this action movie is that you believe the people you see in the screen. You care for them and everything they go through. All of the scenes are influential, the script and the score are iconic. Two thumbs up!\\', \\'A masterpiece and one of the best action heist movies of all time! Heat (1995) is one of my personal favorite Al Pacino and Robert De Niro Action heist movie of all time! I love this movie to death! This movie has everything, action, drama, heist, great cast and incredible realistic great performance from Al Pacino and Robert De Niro! Provides fast and loose action with interesting characters. Great action movie!!!! One of the best for me!!!!!!!!! To this day this movie stands a classic action heist movie of all time! Acting, story, score everything in here is excellent!This movie has a great plot, brilliant story about two lead characters a professional master thief Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) battling Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) LAPD robbery-homicide detective in this non-stop race against time heist. Michael Mann did everything with this film, he wrote the screenplay, produced this movie and directed it. Michael Mann is a brilliant director I love Miami Vice TV Series, Manhunter and Collateral.This movie is the real heist movie un like Point Break and Baby Driver this movie deserves a 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors and great stunts. Without the vision, this film would be nothing. Without the tools, this film would be nothing.Al Pacino stars in the film as Vincent Hanna, a relentless lieutenant in the LAPD\\\\\\'s Robbery Homicide Division who is determined to take down a high end robbery crew led by master thief Neil McCauley (De Niro).Notable for its detailed depiction of the techniques used by both law enforcement and criminal elements, as well as exceptional and accurate gun handling, the film was first made as the 1989 television movie L.A. Takedown. Heat also was reported to have been viewed repeatedly by the \"High Incident Bandits\" robbery duo involved in the infamous North Hollywood shootout (as depicted in the film 44 Minutes: The North Hollywood Shootout).Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) LAPD robbery-homicide detective was a great character cop. He was at least MILES way better than Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) FBI rookie Agent in Point Break that movie sucked! Lt. Vincent Hanna shoot and killed Michael Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) and he saved a child. He cracked the case and he figure it out who the mask robbers were. In the climatic epic battle fight on the end of the film on the airport field he shoot and killed Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro). He destroyed and hunt down McCauley\\\\\\'s crew. True two got away but he always got his man. He at least didn\\\\\\'t let go McCauley like Johnny Utah did, letting go Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) and he did not arrest or shoot or kill any of Bodhi\\\\\\'s men he let them all go. Lt. Vincent Hanna is a hero and veteran police officer to me.Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro), as a professional thief was smart, intelligent, high profile criminal with no criminal record. He was the mastermind behind the robberies, he knew what he was doing. He was a murderer and he did what he know best. He at least wasn\\\\\\'t like stupid dumb idiot Bodhi from Point Break, he was trying to get away but he always settle a score with everyone that double crossed him. It is wrong to messing with him. By the end that way leaded him to his end, he made a mistake when he went after Waingro (Kevin Gage).The movie has also one of the greatest shootouts in L.A. in which Shiherlis (Val Kilmer), Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) McCauley (Robert De Niro) firing Colt Model 733 automatic riffle on the cops. Great shootout\\\\\\'s I love it.The movie has great famous cast: Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Ted Levine, Dennis Haysbert, William Fichtner, Natalie Portman, Tom Noonan, Kevin Gage, Danny Trejo, Hank Azaria, Martin Ferrero and Xander Berkeley a lot of famous actors and actresses were extra in this movie.The movie focus on a real human characters that they are ordinary people with normal life\\\\\\'s like you and me. That is why I love this film to death! It is realistic performed and it has no jokes or fantasy or anything it is real life. I love Al Pacino and Robert De Niro\\\\\\'s performance they both fit the task and accomplish their acting their characters.Heat is the 1995 crime drama directed by Michael Mann and marked the first on screen pairing of legendary actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.10/10 My all time personal favorite action heist masterpiece Michael Mann film of all time, this movie kicks ass.\\', \"Wow. First saw this in the cinema back in 1996 and of course we all raved over how good it was but I don\\'t think we really appreciated it back then or could have as twenty somethings.Now I\\'m late forties this made more sense. That obsession with something at the cost of relationships. McCauley could have been out of there a free man but something in him pulled him another way.In the bible that something comes in the guise of a serpent. That\\'s how subtle it creeps up upon us.Great film.\", \"Every 2-3 years i come back to this movie and watch it again and again, just a reminder of the 90\\'s movies with cops and robbers...one of the best cop movie ever!\", \"One of the amazing things about Heat is that during an almost three hour running time of the film, your interest in what happens in the summit teaming of Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro never flags for a second. Part of the reason is because these guys are at the top of their profession and brought their A game to the parts. The roles they have are not as good as Jake LaMotta, Jimmy Conway, or Max Cady for DeNiro or Frank Serpico, Michael Corleone, or Bobby Deefield for Pacino. But Neil McCauley master criminal for DeNiro and Jake Hanna dogged detective for Pacino does show these guys at their best.You can best describe Heat as a long running version of Law and Order Criminal Intent with a big budget. Like that show the action shifts back from the cops to the criminals and smoothly for director/writer Michael Mann. We see both of these guys as rather similar to each other. DeNiro prides himself on the fact that he says he can drop any relationship if it interferes with work. And Pacino is on his third marriage and his mistress is the job. He\\'s been a failure twice as a husband and about to go thrice in the romance department.Mann gave Pacino and DeNiro a really outstanding cast for support in Heat. People like Val Kilmer are in DeNiro\\'s gang, Jon Voight is the Sam Jaffe like mastermind of the operation. Pacino on his team has Mykel T. Williamson from Forrest Gump and Ted Levine best known as Captain Stottlemyre on Monk.This action film also does not stint on woman\\'s roles. Diane Venora is fine as Pacino\\'s estranged wife. Amy Breneman is also good as DeNiro\\'s woman who watches her man helplessly trapped by his own criminal rules go to his destruction. Best in the film on the distaff side is Ashley Judd as Val Kilmer\\'s loyal wife who has one great choice given her by Williamson, betray her husband or lose their kid. See how she handles it.Although the scene was shoehorned into the plot and would never happen in real life, Pacino and DeNiro do meet and have a brief scene together over a cup of coffee in a diner. They compare notes so to speak and take the measure of the other guy. Since these two guys are the most acclaimed actors of their generation, the scene artificial though it is takes on a whole different dimension. It\\'s like when writers give Queen Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots a climatic meeting scene even though in real life it never happened.But like in Heat, it should have happened.\"]',\n",
              "       '[\\'I was surprised at how good this movie is. A remake of a movie starring Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart and William Holden, directed by one of the greats of American cinema, Billy Wilder, is not exactly the kind of task for the faint of heart. The fact that Sydney Pollack (They Shoot Horses Don\\\\\\'t They? (1969), Tootsie (1982), Out of Africa (1985), etc.) decided to do it must have raised a few eyebrows in Hollywood land.And let\\\\\\'s just say I had preconceptions as I sat down to watch this. No way could this be anything near as good as the original. And for the first twenty minutes or so I was not dissuaded. Julia Ormond, who was given Miss Hepburn\\\\\\'s title role, seemed nothing far removed from ordinary; and Greg Kinnear, who played the playboy David Larrabee, seemed a poor imitation of William Holden. Of course Harrison Ford, I told myself, is another story, since he is the embodiment of the fulfillment of the desire of many woman, and a fine, accomplished leading man. He would be, I suspected, the lone bright spot. In the original, Humphrey Bogart, a little past his prime, and in not exactly the best of moods, and not entirely pleased with the relatively inexperienced Audrey Hepburn, played the cool tycoon Linus Larrabee with some distracted forbearance in what many consider one of his lesser performances. Surely Harrison Ford could improve on that.He did, but what really surprised me was just how diabolically clever the oh, so romantic script by Barbara Benedek and David Rayfiel turned out to be. I mean, Cinderella move over. Sabrina could not have achieved a more glorious existence had she died and gone to heaven. It is hard to imagine a more fulfilling fantasy for a chauffeur\\\\\\'s daughter than what transpires here.Quickly here\\\\\\'s the premise of this celluloid fairy tale/romance: Pretty but ordinary Sabrina, born of working class parents, her father the chauffeur of the ultra rich Larrabees, grows up living above the garage in the palatial Larrabee estate. She watches the lavish parties thrown by the Larrabees from a spot in a tree and falls madly in the kind of puppy love that never goes away with the younger of the Larrabee brothers, David, who is the kind of guy who gives playboys a bad name. When she comes of age, she goes away to Paris (apparently to work for a fashion magazine: in the original Sabrina, she goes to a cooking school in Paris), picks up confidence and a new kind of eye-popping sophistication, comes back and...well, gets noticed.The basic skeleton of this, the story from the first Sabrina (1954), which is dreamily romantic enough and then some, is greatly augmented here with some very fine psychological touches including developing Sabrina\\\\\\'s character beyond the pretty and stylish to something bordering on the wise and heroic. Suffice it to say that we come away feeling she deserves every rainbow\\\\\\'s end she gets. I can see Benedek and Rayfiel exclaiming with riotous joy as they are writing the script (trading e-mails perhaps): \"They want romance, they want woman\\\\\\'s fantasy? They want Sabrina to have a pot of gold and true love everlasting? How about riches beyond counting and the doting attention of the two handsome, very rich brothers? She can take her pick. We\\\\\\'ve give \\\\\\'em romance, we\\\\\\'ll give \\\\\\'em dreams come true!\" And they do. Not only that, but they keep us guessing about who gets the girl until the last possible moment, and they do that very cleverly.Of course it helps to have professional direction by Sydney Pollack and a fine cast including Harrison Ford--at his best, by the way--and Julia Ormond, a hard-working and talented actress (I recall her from Smilla\\\\\\'s Sense of Snow, 1997), who knows how to be cute without fawning, supported by Greg Kinnear, Nancy Marchand, John Wood and Angie Dickinson. I mention Miss Dickinson because, as the mother of a perspective bride about to throw an incredibly lavish wedding, she gets to deliver this \"let them eat cake\" line: \"We thought we\\\\\\'d use recycled paper\" (for the wedding invitations).The script is full of similar witticisms, some verbal, some like eye candy. For example, when Sabrina removes her glasses (the usual Hollywood signal for the adolescent ugly duckling to become a beautiful swan) after gaining sophistication in Paris, she quotes aptly but surprisingly from Gertrude Stein: \"America is my country and Paris is my home.\" (Of course Gertrude Stein never heard of Paris, Texas--but that is another film, and besides, I digress...)I also liked it when Sabrina is in the arms of her Paris would-be lover who kisses her, and--noticing that she is not as engaged as she might me–observes with perfect decorum, \"I\\\\\\'m embarrassed that you\\\\\\'re somewhere else.\"Memorable was the shot of Harrison Ford momentarily looking jealous and hurt. By the way, he has a number of good lines, and he delivers them well.I especially liked it when he sadly confessed: \"I was sent to deal with you. I sent myself.\" It is probably better if you haven\\\\\\'t seen the original and can experience this on its own merits without the odiousness that sometimes comes with comparisons. Comparing Audrey Hepburn with Julia Ormond is like comparing Grace Kelly with Jennifer Lopez. They really are very different people. And comparing Billy Wilder\\\\\\'s 1954 film (from the play by Samuel Taylor) is a little like comparing Lon Chaney\\\\\\'s Phantom of the Opera with Andrew Lloyd Webber\\\\\\'s.Bottom line: see this for both Harrison Ford who wears the business-first character of the \"only surviving heart donor\" very well, and for Julia Ormond whose intense and beguiling performance makes us forgive her for not being Audrey Hepburn.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can\\\\\\'t Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)\\', \\'Romantic is the word for this movie.  The story, the settings, everything adds up to romantic. And it\\\\\\'s clean - no gratuitous sex scenes or foul language!  A rarity for a 90s movie.  This movie has a timeless quality to it, and part of the reason is the (again) extremely romantic score!  Many critics panned this version of \"Sabrina\", unfairly comparing it to the original Audrey Hepburn \"Sabrina\".  Nobody could ever compare to Audrey Hepburn, but Julia Ormond is a fine Sabrina in her own right.  She makes the transition from awkward teen to glamorous woman with subtlety and grace. Greg Kinnear shows a natural flair for acting in his first major movie role.\\', \\'I saw the original \"Sabrina\" before ever seeing the remake. I adored Audrey Hepburn in all of her movies, and this was not an exception. Her comedic timing was perfect. She was completely believable as a young ingenue, and of course, she would not be Audrey Hepburn if she weren\\\\\\'t absolutely breakthtaking on screen. But while I enjoyed the original, I have seen it only once, whereas I have seen the remake so many times I have lost count! The 1995 \"Sabrina\" is a gem of a film. I keep hearing myself describe it as funny, but sometimes I wonder if that\\\\\\'s even the right word. That\\\\\\'s because except for that rather unexpected burst of laughter from Linus\\\\\\' secretary, which cracks me up EVERY time I get to that part, I have never found myself laughing aloud while watching this movie. But the humor is so cleverly written, it is impossible to ignore just how charming and comical this movie is.The script is wonderfully brought to life by the outstanding cast. Harrison Ford is superb as Linus Larrabee. He plays Linus as a serious and almost ruthless businessman, and yet gains our sympathy as he gradually shows a tender and vulnerable side to Linus\\\\\\' cool exterior. Greg Kinnear is well-cast as Linus\\\\\\' dish of a younger brother, David. True, David is self-centered, careless, and carefree. But Greg Kinnear plays him with utter charm that we understand why Sabrina and women in general are so taken with him. And what of Julia Ormond? Well, I think she was absolutely perfect as Sabrina. If she had felt any trepidation essaying the role that had been so closely identified with an icon like Audrey Hepburn, none of her nerves translated on to the screen. She IS Sabrina. I think it\\\\\\'s a wonderful combination of her beauty and acting skills that helped her succeed in this role. The sincerity of her performance makes Sabrina so appealing and completely lovable.The performances of the three leads are complemented by a fine supporting cast made up of John Wood, Nancy Marchand, Dana Ivey, Richard Crenna, and Angie Dickinson. Some of the film\\\\\\'s funniest moments involve their characters. And then there is the exquisite soundtrack composed by John Williams. The score is at once dreamy and intoxicating. Two songs that were written for the movie, \"(In the) Moonlight\" and \"How Can I Remember?\", are just as memorable and perfectly capture the feelings of romance and longing.Hollywood has made a number of successful romantic movies, and I think \"Sabrina\" ranks as one of its best. Its charm never wears off. It sweeps you off your feet and makes your heart soar. It is a marvelous, marvelous film!\\', \\'I really liked this film. The acting, the music, the dialogue, the gorgeous scenes of Paris and New England, and the glamourous parties. Julia Ormond is no Audrey Hepburn, but who is? I think she hit all the right notes as the shy, clumsy girl who goes away, blossoms, and comes home confident and glamourous. Ormond\\\\\\'s Sabrina never loses her innocence or her good heart. Greg Kinnear was hilarious as the lovable ladies\\\\\\' man (and looks a lot like William Holden in the original). Nancy Marchand was hysterically funny as the crabby Mrs. Larabee, and John Wood turned in a good performance as Sabrina\\\\\\'s father.But I did have a harder time with Harrison Ford\\\\\\'s Linus. He seemed too dark and too greedy to buy as loving Sabrina, even when he called off the merger. It always seemed to ring false in a way. He seemed a lot like the character of Richard in \"Caroline in the City\". But I regress. This is a very good movie!\\', \\'1995 saw the release of a great American romantic comedy in Hollywood tradition, \"The American president\", but it\\\\\\'s Pollack\\\\\\'s \"Sabrina\" that deserves the title because it\\\\\\'s based on the 1954\\\\\\' classic, directed by Billy Wilder and starring Audrey Hepburn, William Holden and Humphrey Bogart. Yet, there\\\\\\'s more in \"Sabrina\" than a simple remake.There is a natural reflex from every movie buff, which is to prefer any \"original\" film to its remake. It often has to do with the classic status reached by the first movie, inevitably dismissing any attempt to remake it. But at the risk of sounding like another heretic, I thought Sydney Pollack\\\\\\'s remake, if not better, is a solid match to the original acting-wise and more than anything, storytelling-wise.I insist on the storytelling department because it contradicts the idea of the original\\\\\\'s greatness relying on its monumental cast, incomparable to the Sidney Pollack, Harrison Ford, Greg Kinnear and Julia Osmond\\\\\\'s quartet. Yet \"Sabrina\" approaches the two myths of Cinderella and the Ugly Duckling and ask for us to root for Sabrina, a woman who never attracted men, yet ended up being in the middle of a business scheme, until winning the heart of a businessman. No matter how fairytale, the material is, its convincingness is not to be taken for granted, and no matter how great are the actors, their transformation, their chemistry is still something that depend on the storytelling, more than the acting.And it\\\\\\'s extraordinary how Pollack not only remains faithful to the fairytale aspect of the story and to the sensitivities of the 90\\\\\\'s in the same time, starting with the heroine herself. Sabrina is supposed to be the Ugly Duckling, she\\\\\\'s the chauffeur\\\\\\'s daughter who spent most of her time in David\\\\\\'s shadow, before finding herself during her trip in Paris. The problem with Audrey Hepburn is that she was incapable of being unattractive no matter how hard she, or the make-up and costume design, tried. Julia Osmond, on the other hand, being that unknown brunette with the same sweet charm as Juliette Binoche, with small glasses and long hair, is convincing as the not-too attractive girl on the surface.And the new script doesn\\\\\\'t insult our intelligence by labeling her as a \\\\\\'dog\\\\\\', she\\\\\\'s just a shy, insecure person who had to discover her inner attractiveness before ever trying to seducing. And the Paris\\\\\\' transformation give much more depth and consistence to her evolution, when she comes back, we know Sabrina hasn\\\\\\'t turned into a glamorous woman but as a confident one. Paris\\\\\\' effect is really palpable and makes it strangely believable that David wouldn\\\\\\'t recognize Sabrina. I\\\\\\'m not saying that these details hurt the original film, but Pollack, probably moved by a humble desire to pay tribute to the \\\\\\'untouchable\\\\\\' classic, compensated the modest cast through a particular attention to human details, that inevitably highlighted the original\\\\\\'s flaws.And the real masterstroke comes with the casting of Harrison Ford as Linus. Ford exudes the perfect mix of seriousness and vulnerability. He easily passes as a grown-up man who spent so much behind the office that someone had to show him the preciousness of life, and how it can\\\\\\'t afford to be wasted. And all through his interactions with Sabrina, we keep on wondering if he\\\\\\'s aware that he\\\\\\'s falling in love, and if it\\\\\\'s reciprocal. Both Linus and Sabrina are part of a hypocrisy that betray an endearing defenselessness, and makes them two persons ironically fitting one another. And while Pollack could have kept the movie\\\\\\'s track and bring David to make the deal possible, he also develops his seemingly one-dimensional personality.I liked Holden in \"Sabrina\", and his chemistry with Hepburn was so sincere it really veiled any hint of sentiment toward the elderly Bogart. But Holden\\\\\\'s shining moment when he accepts to marry his fiancée almost felt like a deus-ex-machina. How could David finally give Sabrina up so eagerly? Well, Pollack gave me satisfying answers by making David grow up in maturity, by taken into consideration that his character\\\\\\'s arc had to be closed by the fact that for the first time, he\\\\\\'ll allow his brother to live his life. And strangely, the romantic comedy, also turns into a subtle and positive satire about family relationships in business, allowing Nancy Marchand to shine as the authoritarian, yet compassionate mother.What I admire most in the remake is Pollack\\\\\\'s attachment to make the story more believable and endearing by today\\\\\\'s standards, he knows he won\\\\\\'t reach the same legendary status as the original, but he knows that this very status asks for believability. His characters are extremely well-developed, he gives a spectacular supporting cast to his movies, and the whole film is such a delight to watch, that nothing could have ruined it. The ending was the only hit-or-miss, and while I thought the hug between Hepburn and Bogart was awkward, just a kiss in Paris wouldn\\\\\\'t have been enough to ruin the whole efforts.But I wasn\\\\\\'t surprised, that Linus would apologize to Sabrina, considering the scene where he broke her heart, a scene whose emotionality clearly surpasses the original. I loved that he asked for her help, because he needed her, and in return open her heart on how much she needs him. That\\\\\\'s what I call, a beautiful romance, comedic or not, it was the perfect conclusion for a movie that had so much to prove to be respected, and that even managed to be superior to the original film, and it\\\\\\'s one of the rare instances where I\\\\\\'m not hesitant to give it a higher rating.It doesn\\\\\\'t diminish the classic status of Billy Wilder\\\\\\'s \"Sabrina\", Julia Osmond is not Audrey Hepburn, and Harrison Ford isn\\\\\\'t Bogart, but like I said for the previous film, good ingredient don\\\\\\'t necessarily make a good meal, what matters is how the director makes his interactions believable and emotionally appealing. And Pollack brilliantly succeeds in both exercises.\\', \\'Tempting though it may be to compare this film to the 1954 version, you will miss the point if you do. To understand the true magic of Sydney Pollack\\\\\\'s masterpiece, read the Samuel A. Taylor play both films were based on. While I\\\\\\'m sure the play was a great evening out at the theater between martinis in the 1950s, it\\\\\\'s somewhat incredible that two film versions so profoundly translated this lightweight romantic comedy, each in its own time.In 1954, Billy Wilder used an incredible cast to entertain. No, Bogart should never have been cast. Cary Grant might have created the dynamic relationship with Audrey Hepburn we fortunately got to see later in Charade, but if Bogart had not been cast would the film hold its classic status? Hepburn transfixed an audience and brought to the world La Vie en Rose. William Holden is period eye candy, and the film will always be fun.Forty years later, however, Pollack made an important film. Taylor\\\\\\'s play is, after all, just a fairy tale, and this film fully realizes it. Ormond is enchanting. Kinnear ripens the always empty David. Fanny Ardant brings a french cinema quality to the film\\\\\\'s Paris episodes. Marchand\\\\\\'s \"I didn\\\\\\'t teach you this\" culminates what may be one of the best written scenes in American film. You can watch this scene over and over and each time gain a better understanding of how great acting can define a relationship, this one between mother and son, for an audience.But this film should have been called Linus. Harrison Ford\\\\\\'s tour de force performance as the greater Larrabee fulfills Pollack\\\\\\'s mission to tell a simple story of how a king is transformed by the love of a woman.\"It was a lie, then it was a dream.\"\\', \\'The temptation to compare it with the 1954 version is not small. And it is a good thing because the film has the force to use its voice. Julia Ormond is realy Sabrina. And Harrison Ford is a revelation as Linus. But, for me, the authetic good points are Miriam Colon as lovely Rosa and Nancy Marchand as wise,fascinating Maude Larrabee. Short, a seductive film.\\', \\'Comparisons are hardly ever fair, yet people insist on making them. DON\\\\\\'T compare this film to the original. Who cares? Judge it on it\\\\\\'s own merits, and you\\\\\\'ll come up with a winner. The interaction between the players is seamless. The dialog is witty, intelligent, at times touching, and always believable.This \"Sabrina\" is a delight. A truly classic romantic comedy in the finest sense of the word. Harrison Ford portrays Linus Larrabee, perfectly blending ruthless billionaire and socially awkward male. Flawless in business matters, he\\\\\\'s out of his element and totally unprepared for the consequences of what he originally deems a simple matter, turning Sabrina Fairchild\\\\\\'s interest to himself instead of brother David (Greg Kinnear), thereby saving both an impending marriage and lucrative corporate merger.Julia Ormond\\\\\\'s Sabrina is just the right mixture of sophistication and innocence. Daughter of the Larrabee\\\\\\'s chauffeur, she\\\\\\'s grown up on the family estate, yet outside of their social circle, of course. Passionately in love with youngest son David Larrabee, we see her in the movie\\\\\\'s opening moments hard at her favorite pastime, spying on David and fantasizing that she is the girl he\\\\\\'s currently schmoozing at mother Maude\\\\\\'s annual birthday bash. Her father, Thomas Fairchild (John Wood) in an effort to broaden her horizons and get her past this obsession with David, arranges with Maude (Nancy Marchand) to send Sabrina to Paris for a year. He hopes she will learn about life and independence while working in the Paris offices of Vogue.While Sabrina is away, David meets beautiful Elizabeth Tyson (Lauren Holly), up and coming pediatrician. Coincidentally, she is the daughter of Patrick Tyson (Richard Crenna), owner of Tyson Electronics, a high technology firm that Linus has had his eye on for some time. As his brother\\\\\\'s relationship blossoms, Linus quietly begins buying up Tyson stock.To Linus, everything seems to be proceeding as it should be. David and Elizabeth have finally set a date. He and Patrick Tyson are in serious merger negotiations. Maude and Ingrid Tyson (Angie Dickenson) are planning their children\\\\\\'s monster wedding. All is about to change, however. A year has passed. Once again, Maude\\\\\\'s birthday party approaches. It\\\\\\'s also time for Sabrina to come home.Director Sydney Pollack does an exceptional job, mixing just the right recipe of romance and comedy throughout. We, the audience, are just as stunned as the movie\\\\\\'s characters at the \"new\" Sabrina. With a Parisian haircut, in chic black with enormous sunglasses, she is nearly as unrecognizable to us as she obviously is to David. In town to pick up a gift for his mother, David, ever the playboy, offers what he clearly sees as an incredibly hot girl a lift home. He has no idea it\\\\\\'s Sabrina, and she exacts a small measure of delicious revenge during the ride, watching him squirm uncomfortably as he tries vainly to remember who she is.To make amends and intrigued by the mystery, David invites her to \"his house\" for a drink. She accepts gleefully. The charade continues until they arrive at the Larrabee estate (quite a bit of which was filmed at the Harrison Conference Center in Glen Cove, NY), whereupon Linus instantly recognizes her and welcomes her home.Linus, who never misses much, also sees trouble. Big trouble, judging by the smitten look on his brother\\\\\\'s face. Thomas Fairchild, in turn, watching his daughter steam out a dress for Maude\\\\\\'s party, doesn\\\\\\'t like it much either. This was not at all what he had planned when he sent her to Paris.The night of Maude\\\\\\'s party arrives, complete with a live band, perfect weather (\"It never rained on a Larrabee party. The Larrabee\\\\\\'s wouldn\\\\\\'t have allowed it...\"), and, this time, as an invited guest, Sabrina.Admittedly, there are many actresses on screen today for whom the word \"beautiful\" is but a pale description. Even so, I would put Ormand\\\\\\'s Sabrina on the party\\\\\\'s walkway as one of the most incredibly stunning appearances of all time. She is, literally, breathtaking. And David, to the panicked concern of his mother and brother, is done when he sees her. Finished. Forget Elizabeth. Forget the impending marriage. He sees nothing but Sabrina, while Maude and Linus see a billion dollar merger about to go into the tank.That\\\\\\'s enough plot synopsis. Suffice it to say that Linus and Maude decide to get David out of the way while Linus puts right what is going terribly wrong. You\\\\\\'ll have to watch the rest of this charming film to see how it all turns out.The casting is first class. Besides Ford and Ormond, Nancy Marchand\\\\\\'s Maude is acerbically intelligent, blending wealthy arrogance (Can\\\\\\'t we SEND somebody?\") and human compassion for Sabrina, with a deep love, and intimate knowledge of the psychology of her two sons. Greg Kinnear shines as the lovably lazy David, who works hardest at doing nothing productive. Lauren Holly\\\\\\'s Elizabeth is the perfect opposite.The supporting players are no less capable in their respective roles. John Wood is always elegant as the quintessential chauffeur and loving father. It brought a smile to see Crenna and Dickenson together again as the Tysons, and veteran character actress Dana Ivey is a gem as Mack, Linus\\\\\\' watchdog assistant (But he PAYS me to tell him...\"). Some of the movie\\\\\\'s best scenes are with the remainder of the ensemble cast in the servant\\\\\\'s kitchen, particularly those with Rosa (Miriam Colon).So, in conclusion, I emphatically urge you to rent, or better still, buy this film. Though the Bogart/Hepburn purists will probably flame me into oblivion, I\\\\\\'m sure you\\\\\\'ll find it entertaining, heartwarming, and absolutely leisure time well spent!\\', \\'SABRINA, in my opinion, is a sweet, heartwarming, and charming romance with terrific performances. If you ask me, the way that Sabrina (Julia Ormond) and David (Greg Kinnear) met up again after several years was very romantic. It was also really funny when a ménage à trois began after Linus (Harrison Ford) fell for her, too. As far as I can see, this movie had terrific performances, excellent direction, perfect casting, and nice scenery, especially for a movie set in New York. Oh, yes, the Paris scenery was especially lovely. In conclusion, if you are a fan of Harrison Ford, Julia Ormond, or Greg Kinnear, you should definitely see this movie. Prepare for lots of charm, wit, laughs, and romance when you see it.\\']',\n",
              "       '[\"We all know the story. There have been some pretty good Tom Sawyer movies made. This one capitalizes on star power for an audience that probably has never heard of the principle character. Putting these motives aside, it just doesn\\'t work the best. While Jonathan Taylor Thomas is an adequate Tom, Brad Renfro is not a very good Huck. He is too much of a pretty boy. He is much too bright, though his character tries to make him otherwise. If you\\'ve read Twain, you know that he is tremendously superstitious and has really rough edges, both mentally and physically. He is kind of whiny in this movie. Becky Thatcher looks to be about 25 years old and stands next to Tom like a giant. She pushes him around and dominates. Obviously, the director decided to make her an attractive character to young women. That\\'s not bad, but it betrays the spirit of the period in which it was written. They should at least have looked about the same age. There are good scenes. The graveyard scene is well done. Injun Joe is threatening and murderous. The funeral scene is a disappointment. It needed to be milked a bit. Some of the peripheral characters could have been more developed. The conclusion works OK. However, it needed a dose of truth and believability to carry it through. See it, but don\\'t expect a lot.\", \\'Spoiler warning! This is a mixed-bag when it comes to story-telling.  Some scenes work quite well, others are totally poor. One of the weakest is the famous \"engagement\" scene.  It is thrown away as a totally one-note sentimental piece, and misses the comic potential of the scene. The version of TOM SAWYER starring Johnny Whittaker and Jodie Foster delivered it a lot better. Brad Renfro does a technically brilliant performance here.  He can obviously relate to Huck very well and there is obviously some parallels with his own life.  Unfortunately, he doesn\\\\\\'t suit Huck as a classic story character, and he certainly doesn\\\\\\'t suit the style of the rest of this movie.  The effect is like Robert DeNiro doing his TAXI DRIVER role in the middle of a Laurel & Hardy comedy.  It takes a lot of skill to make these styles fit together, and it\\\\\\'s certainly out of the league of the production of this film. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is fairly good as Tom.  He does the climactic court scene very well, and he is generally charming and mischevious.  But he lacks the depth to make the character really come alive.  The whitewashing scene is fairly good, though I\\\\\\'ve seen better. Not bad, but certainly no classic.  The previous film THE ADVENTURES OF HUCK FINN is actually a far better adaptation of a famous Twain novel.\\', \\'There are things that Tom and Huck does do right. The three best things about it are the production values, the score and Eric Schweig as Injun Joe. The film looks very pretty with quite evocative costumes and sets, while the score is both memorable and relaxing. Schweig is perfect as Injun Joe and genuinely menacing, though the writers perhaps go a little overboard with the villainous and somewhat violent side to him. Brad Renfro does do well as Huck, the character does come across as too sullen and hard but Renfro is suitably mischievous and brings some fun amongst bringing out a somewhat conflicted side to Huck. There are some effective scenes, the graveyard scene is very atmospheric and the moment when Injun Joe starts to stir/stirs when Tom is reaching for the map sends chills up the spine. The whitewashing scene is very charming as well. There are some mixed feelings assets here. Jonathan Taylor Thomas(of whom Tom and Huck is like a vehicle for him early in his career) makes for a spirited Tom but the more dramatic moments(the courtroom scene is quite good though) show signs of inexperience. Peter Hewitt\\\\\\'s filmography has been hit and miss, Tom and Huck is one of his better films and thankfully is not another Zoom or Thunderpants but his best film will always be Bill and Ted\\\\\\'s Bogus Journey(that and The Borrowers, of the films I\\\\\\'ve seen so far of his, are the only ones that have ratings better than decent). Tom and Huck does have its failings though, the worst case was the grossly out-of-kilter way Becky was written, if there is a more selfish and bitchy Becky on any film adaptation of Tom Sawyer it\\\\\\'s yet to be seen and Rachael Leigh Cook while attractive does come across as forced and stereotypical-teen-like in her acting. There are some fun moments injected in the more nostalgic and charming moments seen in the first half but the second half, where it\\\\\\'s all suspense thriller and Injun Joe on the rampage feels like a different film altogether, the two halves just juxtapose too much. The crucial scenes are there even when the adaptation is quite loose but the heart is lacking. The funeral scene falls flat being very under-characterised and rushed through, and the \"engagement\" scene came across as overly-sentimental(an attempt by Disney to make the story more timely) and awkward as well. The worst bit of dialogue was Becky\\\\\\'s \"What? I\\\\\\'m not the first? I hope you die\", not only is it a terrible and shallow thing to say in the first place but it is something that Becky would never dream of saying. Much of the dialogue is weak, not just that line from Becky but the whole style is not very nuanced and it feels at times too modern. Little attempt also is made to bringing Missouri\\\\\\'s dialect, language and how they speak, the production values did a great job in being evocative, why didn\\\\\\'t the writing make an effort too? And this is coming from someone to makes a big effort in judging films/TV series/literary adaptations on their own terms. Other than Huck, Injun Joe and to a lesser extent Tom, the rest of the actors suffer from their characters being underdeveloped and don\\\\\\'t register as a result really. To conclude, Tom and Huck is alright as a film though with many problems but along with the Soviet film(with the bad dubbing, pacing and editing) it is one of the weaker adaptations of a great book. 5/10 Bethany Cox\\', \"Tom Sawyer (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) runs away and is rescued by Huck Finn (Brad Renfro). They see Injun Joe and Muff Potter digging up the grave of Vic \\'One-Eyed\\' Murrell to retrieve a treasure map for Doctor Robinson. Injun Joe murders Doc Robinson with Muff\\'s knife. Muff is arrested for the murder. Tom is torn between an oath to Huck and his need to exonerate an innocent man.The production looks weak. This Disney doesn\\'t have the needed edge and doesn\\'t even have Disney money. The story has too many killings to be a kiddie movie. The movie doesn\\'t have the grittiness to feel real. Jonathan Taylor Thomas used to be a thing back in the day. He\\'s cute with a twinkle in his eye. I don\\'t lay too much on him. He just doesn\\'t have the toughness unlike Brad Renfro. Rachael Leigh Cook is a cutie in this one. This movie\\'s tone is all over the place.\", \\'This version of the classic novel by Mark Twain makes a nice little movie, but fails to capture the humorous spirit of the book. Many hilarious scenes are missing and the writers have taken too many liberties with the plot.Jonathan Taylor Thomas is wonderful as Tom Sawyer. Unfortunately his charm does not last until the very end of the movie, but seems to fade after a while. It might possibly have something to do with the fact, that, even though this movie is based on \"The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer\", it\\\\\\'s actually Huck\\\\\\'s character that steals the whole show.I had a bit of a problem with the way Huck Finn was portrayed in this movie. Of course Brad Renfro is a fantastic actor (his performance is probably the best thing about this film) and he manages to give Huck Finn many tragic and deep aspects. Unfortunately Mark Twain\\\\\\'s Huck Finn is neither tragic or very deep. One can only wonder why Huck has been made the brooding hero, when it\\\\\\'s actually Tom Sawyer, who is supposed to be the brightest star in this story.Despite the many sugar-coated scenes and the fact that both Tom and Huck are a bit out-of-character, this movie is still something worth seeing. Injun Joe and Muff Potter are both realistic and Rachael Leigh Cook makes a brilliant and not-so-girly Becky Thatcher! The sets and wardrobe look very authentic, but they alone are not enough to bring the evergreen story wholly alive.\\', \\'A mischievous young boy, Tom Sawyer (Jonathan Taylor Thomas),witnesses a murder by the deadly Injun Joe. Tom becomes friends with Huckleberry Finn (Brad Renfro), a boy with no future and no family.Going through the Top 250 lists from various years, somehow this ended up on the list for 1996. Of all the lists from 1996 through 2014, this first list is the most bizarre. Others have films that clearly do not belong, but none more than the 1996 list. And this is a prime example. How did a film that barely ranks above 5 out of 10 manage to be considered one of the best of all time? Not that this is a bad film. As far as kid stories go, it is alright, and not the worst introduction to the world of Mark Twain. But it is clearly not intended to be a masterpiece, but more like something one might see on the Hallmark channel. Just a showcase for the now-forgotten Jonathan Taylor Thomas.\\', \\'Oh, where to begin with this movie. I\\\\\\'ll start with some of the good: Eric Schweig was perfectly cast as the murderous, intimidating, menacing Injun Joe. If I could create my own Tom Sawyer classic movie, I\\\\\\'d recast him. Same with Michael McShane as Muff Potter. Jonathan Taylor Thomas sounds like the perfect Tom Sawyer on paper; he does have a history of playing rambunctious, trouble-making boys, and he has a special place in my heart as Simba from The Lion King, my favorite Disney movie. But here...he\\\\\\'s just alright. He doesn\\\\\\'t have as much of the edge that made Tom Sawyer such a fascinating, dynamic character. Most of the blame for that goes to the writers though; I\\\\\\'m sure Thomas would have done much better had he been given better material to work with. Everyone else was sorely miscast (i.e Huckleberry Finn, Becky Thatcher, Aunt Polly, Widow Douglas, Joe Harper, etc.), and the characters who did have decent casting (Judge Thatcher, Ben Rogers, Mr. Dobbins, etc.) didn\\\\\\'t stand out very much.No attempt was made to create the atmosphere of Tom Sawyer (the dialect, the plot, the setting, the characters, etc.) Every boy, including Tom Sawyer, went barefoot in the book, but in the movie they all wore shoes. This may not seem like a big deal, but it\\\\\\'s part of the edge Tom Sawyer and his friends have in the book; they\\\\\\'re not afraid to get down and dirty in the adventures they have, and the boys who do wear shoes in the book are looked down upon as sissies.Huckleberry Finn in the books was carefree, laid-back, and is satisfied with his independent lifestyle. Although he is despised by every \"respectable\" adult in St. Petersburg, he\\\\\\'s envied and friends with most of the children, and he doesn\\\\\\'t feel sorry for himself. Brad Renfro\\\\\\'s Huck is snide, irritable, sarcastic, and even somewhat of a bully, nothing at all like Twain\\\\\\'s Huck. This Huck DOES feel sorry for himself, and often takes his frustrations out on Tom.Becky Thatcher in the book is a bit too demure and puts on airs. But she isn\\\\\\'t a bitch. In the book, Tom gets back into her good graces by taking the hit for her (literally) and their relationship grows even stronger in the cave scene. In the movie, she\\\\\\'s portrayed as a bitch plain and simple; in fact she holds a continuous grudge against Tom throughout the movie, which makes their bonding in the cave scene really forced. Not to mention that Rachael Leigh Cook as Becky Thatcher is probably the worst case of miscasting in this movie; she was way too old and was a good two heads taller than Jonathan Taylor Thomas. Disney could have made their own version of Tom Sawyer great, especially with Jonathan Taylor Thomas as the lead. What a wasted, missed opportunity.\\', \"It\\'s an awful presentation, the original tale isn\\'t much better - who do these injuns think they are acting as if they own the place. Curious that Mark Twain didn\\'t use someone of white western European descent for his antagonist. Sadly makes this and him a statue that belongs in a museum.\", \\'It may not be exactly like the book but its really good movie. Jonathan Tayler Thomas really always looked to me as the real Tom Sawyer just something about him as TOm fits it to a T. Got some funny characters and Muff seems realistic to me believeable when hes about to die Injun Joe looks terrifying if was around him like hes some insane killer. The very look of him when hes like stick me i mean if a kid dang id be scared too. Huck plays his part well makes him believeable there is other tom and sawyers that been out that follow the book this is just follows it some and makes ire ally good i dont know the down hate on it gesh there is real movies that are bad in every line. But this is fun cool and everyone i think fit it i have the movie and i love it.\\']',\n",
              "       '[\\'I found this to be a very interesting action with with Powers Boothe fun to watch as the main villain, thanks to his dialog and no-nonsense approach. At least he wasn\\\\\\'t one of those talk-first, shoot-maybe-later clichés from the world of film. The hockey scenes in here are realistic, too. However, the rest of the film doesn\\\\\\'t exactly exhibit realism: lots of hokey stuff in here, too. At the end, the action really gets carried away and brings the rating down on this to a manageable \"7.\" Otherwise, it would be a minimum of \"8\" just for the entertainment value alone.After a slow start, it picks up when Boothe enters the movie. Then it never lets up. If you want a pure hour of action, this is it. There is no female lead in this movie, so you get no romance nor gratuitous sex scenes, which is a bit unusual. It\\\\\\'s a straight crime story.One note: unless things have been changed, I was disappointed my DVD did not offer a widescreen version.\\', \\'After the success of \"Die Hard\" there have been many movie clones of that great action film. There was \"Die Hard on a Ship\" (\"Under Siege\"), \"Die Hard on a Train\" (\"Under Siege 2\"), and \"Die Hard on a Bus\" (\"Speed\"), just to name a few. \"Sudden Death\" can be described as either \"Die Hard on the Ice\", \"Die Hard at a Hockey Game\" or \"Die Hard in an Arena\". You pick. Technically you could put all three titles into this movie and it\\\\\\'ll still be pretty much the same thing. However, \"Sudden Death\" is one of the better \"Die Hard\" clones. It\\\\\\'s an exciting movie about terrorists taking over the Pittsburgh Civic Arena where the decisive seventh game of the Stanley Cup Finals between the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Chicago Blackhawks is being played. However there\\\\\\'s a little difference here. The only people who know that hostages have taken over are the people in the VIP box (which includes the Vice President), the Secret Service men outside the arena, and an arena fire marshall who\\\\\\'s two little kids are attending the game. The 17,000-plus fans attending the game have no idea whats really going on. That fire marshall is played by Belgian action star Jean-Claude Van Damme. I\\\\\\'ve not been a big fan of Van Damme\\\\\\'s films, but \"Sudden Death\" is easily his best movie to date. Van Damme plays Darren McCord, the fire marshall who finds out something\\\\\\'s wrong when his little daughter is taken to the VIP box as a hostage after witnessing a killing. When McCord finds out what\\\\\\'s going on, he does precisely what Bruce Willis did in \"Die Hard\", takes on the terrorists all by himself. The lead bad guy is portrayed by Powers Boothe in a frightening performance. He may not be quite as effective as Alan Rickman\\\\\\'s villain in \"Die Hard\", but Boothe does a good job at being mean. Van Damme is also very good too (especially in one scene where he poses as the Penguins goalie to hide out from the bad guys who were chasing him). He\\\\\\'s much better here than he was in \"Timecop\", teaming again with \"Timecop\" director Peter Hyams. The action scenes are splendid (both the gunplay and the action during the game), and the suspense has you on the edge. \"Sudden Death\" has a few silly moments here and there, but since this movie is such a good thrill ride, you won\\\\\\'t care. This movie deserved to be a big hit at the box office and wasn\\\\\\'t. I\\\\\\'ll never understand why.***1/2 (out of four)\\', \"Darren(Jean Claude Van Damme) is a firemen, he carries his sons to a Pittsburgh Penguin national Hockey play-off where is taking place the final.But the arena has been taken by a terrorists led by a cruel villain(Powers Boothe). The bad guys are holding the Vice President(Raymond J. Barry), as well as another authorities taken as hostages in a private box. The chief villain demanding a few billion dollars or he\\'ll blow up the stadium because is wired with enough explosives for killing all around. Meanwhile an Inspector(Dorian Harewood) is also investigating the events and is captured our hero\\'s daughter .This film is plenty of action and explosions and is quite amusing. Displays suspense, thriller, violence, great action scenes and stunts with sensational scenes. Jean Claude Van Damme gets a perfect part who plays cat-and-mouse- with a sardonic nasty, well played by Powers Boothe.The highlights film are the impressive fighting on the stadium\\'s ceiling. The blowing up ,pyrotechnics,struggles are breathtaking but the picture is just another usual Hollywood product in the wake of ¨Die hard¨.Married only by lack credulity for feats of Van Damme and too many needlessly scenes. It packs a high budget and lavishly produced ,however, nowadays Van Damme performs a middling and low budget movies. Spectacular music score fitting to action film by John Debney(Sin city,Passion of Christ).The motion picture is professionally directed by Peter Hyams who repeats with Jean Claude in ¨Timecop¨ . He\\'s an irregular director with hits(Relic,Outland,Capricorn one) and flops(Sound and thunder,End of days).\", \"Darren McCord, a fire safety officer at a hockey stadium, takes his two kids to a major Pittsburgh Penguins game. It just so happens to be the day that extortionist/thieves kidnap the vice president and hold him hostage at the stadium, thus putting himself and his children in mortal danger.Lets cut to the chase here, Sudden Death is a clone rip off of Die Hard, the action template movie that shines as bright as a newly formed bruise, but as copycats go {and there have been reams}, Peter Hyams\\' beefcake blunderbuss movie is an action junkie\\'s delight. Jean Claude Van Damme {McCord obviously} flexes his muscles and not only beats seven bells of tar out of Powers Booth\\'s criminal minions, he also proves to be a hero and loving father to his oblivious children. It\\'s contrived for sure, I mean we get Jean sneaking on to the ice and taking up net minding duties, and it\\'s certainly a script devoid of imagination. But it\\'s got Van Damme fighting a hot kick ass babe in a penguin suit and a last fifteen minutes of high roof/dangling/swinging/exploding mayhem that does the action genre proud.It\\'s no Die Hard, but what genre films are? Sudden Death in spite of its contrivances, is a film that is impossible not to enjoy if you are a like minded adult. 7/10\", \\'If you live anywhere other than Pittsburgh, this movie - much like Striking Distance - is a DVD that you can find in the $1 section. Here, it\\\\\\'s a prized commodity, a remembrance of the Steel City in the 1990\\\\\\'s and a time when the owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins\\\\\\' wife decided that she wanted to make a movie.That\\\\\\'s right - Howard Baldwin, chairman of the Pittsburgh Penguins, was one of the film\\\\\\'s backers. The goal was to use the home opened between the Pens and the Chicago Blackhawks as a backdrop, but there was a lockout due to the owners and players not coming to terms. That meant that an exhibition game between the two teams didn\\\\\\'t have the intensity that the filmmakers wanted, so they got the minor league Johnstown Chiefs and Wheeling Thunderbirds to play in front of 3,000 extras, with the rest of the crowd being cardboard cutouts. Seriously - look for the fake fans.Darren McCord (Van Damme!) may be French Canadian, but he\\\\\\'s a true Yinzer. Once, he was a firefighter but he was unable to save a young girl from a house fire. He lost his wife and barely sees his family, who live in a nice house up on Mt. Washington while he\\\\\\'s probably living in Carrick or Brookline (I\\\\\\'m trying to make this review so Pittsburgh-centric that it will only appear as blips and bleeps to anyone outside of Allegheny County).Now he\\\\\\'s the fire marshall for the Civic Arena - long gone for the several times renamed PPG Paints Arena - and finds himself in the midst of a terrorist situation when former CIA agent Joshua Foss (Powers Boothe, who played Jim Jones in the made for TV movie Guyana Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones) wires the Igloo up with explosives and takes the Vice-President hostage.Yes, this is a movie directly tied into the end of a hockey game causing bombs to blow up an ice hockey arena. A film where JCVD does battle with the Pens\\\\\\' penguin mascot, Iceburgh. Where even supposed good guys are really on the side of evil. And where Van Damme can create homemade flamethrowers and even get on the ice himself to save the day.If you\\\\\\'re a fan of 1990\\\\\\'s hockey, this is the film for you. Jay Caufield, Mario Lemieux and Luc Robitaille, as does venerable Pens announcer Mike Lange, who is one of the few announcers left who isn\\\\\\'t some vanilla pretty boy who barely knows the game. Instead, he\\\\\\'s given to loudly shouted Lange-isms like \"She wants to sell my monkey!\" and \"Get in the fast lane, grandma! This bingo game is ready to roll!\" You can hear his signature \"It\\\\\\'s a hockey night in Pittsburgh!\" call in this film as well. Not to brag, but of all the names in my phone, the fact that I have Lange\\\\\\'s makes me probably the happiest (we worked together on several radio commercials).Director Peter Hyams has an interesting IMDB list, working on films like Capricorn One, The Star Chamber, 2010, Outland, Running Scared, The Presidio, Stay Tuned and Timecop before this one. He\\\\\\'d go on to make The Relic - a film I was asked to quiet down during my laugh-filled viewing of it at Mann\\\\\\'s Chinese Theater - and End of Days. He elevates this above it being just another Die Hard clone.You know who else does? Powers Boothe. He\\\\\\'s one of the best bad guys ever here. And to top it all off, he read the audio book of the film. This is the holy grail here in Pittsburgh, a valuable artifact worth its weight in pierogies.\\', \\'I may be one of those movie buffs who\\\\\\'s at least willing to confess that they\\\\\\'re not a huge admirer or fan of a certain actor or director. Jean-Claude Van Damme would be near the top of my list of actors that I only admire although I\\\\\\'ve seen a few films where he has his name is on the poster.\"Sudden Death\" is the second film that Van Damme has starred in with photographer/director Peter Hyams (\"End of Days\", \"Timecop\") is at the helm.This film was based on an actual story by Karen Baldwin and is adapted into the story by Gene Quintano.The movie takes place at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena in Pittsburgh where the Chicago Blackhawks and the Pittsburgh Penquins are about to take the ice for the last game of the Stanley Cup finals.  Van Damme\\\\\\'s character, Darren McCord, takes his son and daughter to the game.  As usual, the arena is packed with fans and the Vice President of the U.S. has come to see the game as well.  Unfortunately, Joshua Foss (Powers Boothe), a demented terrorist and a small band of terrorists take control of the Owner\\\\\\'s box where the V.P. and several people.  Foss demands that he wants a billion dollars and how he wants to use it puzzles me.  However, at the end of each period, if his demand isn\\\\\\'t met, Foss shoots someone and if the deal isn\\\\\\'t done at the end of the game.  The arena is blown sky high with several explosives that are set all over the arena.Boothe is good here and he makes the threat very real, which is key to making any thriller.  He also shows some wit and in one particular scene, the Vice President curiously asks Foss \"What kind of lunatic are you?\" Foss responds - \"The best kind.\"What draws McCord into the situation is when his daughter is taken up to the Owner\\\\\\'s box.  From there on, the movie manages to make the excitement to be interesting.  One example would be the fight scenes that McCord has with a couple of thugs in the kitchen at two seperate times.  Just about every prop is used from the meat slicer to the bone, which goes through one of the neck of a terrorist.  Fun and yucky isn\\\\\\'t it?The last half of the film is just about entertaining as the first half is.  I\\\\\\'m undecided if \"Sudden Death\" would make the best thriller that involves a sports event and terrorists since John Frankenheimer\\\\\\'s \"Black Sunday\".  Van Damme and Boothe are both good here.\\', \"Since one of my favorite action star of this generation, Michael Jai White want to make an unofficial sequel to a 90s Die Hard scenario movie called Sudden Death staring the great Jean Claude Van Damme so naturally as a fan of Van Damme and all the Die Hard clone movies no matter how bad or low budget they are I\\'m quite excited to finally watch this movie for the first time ever and although its not quite awesome like I anticipated it still quite a treat tbh. Because there nothing original in this movie except the hockey stadium setting so all of my attention is on how good Van Damme carry this movie and needless to say, he does that pretty well with many unique ways to kill the bad guys especially the hilarious and definitely in my top 10 favorite Van Damme action sequences where he battles a villain in a mascot costume.\", \"Sudden Death just might be Jean-Claude Van Damme\\'s best movie to date along with Hard Target,Bloodsport,Lionheart,and Cyborg!Powers Boothe is great and there is always action,great fights and interesting moments in the film!The film is very satisfying and entertaining and recommend for big time action fans!\", \"Van-Damme is known for acting in two film genres: Action and Martial-Arts. His best martial arts film is BloodSport, also thought to be one of the best movies of all time in it\\'s genre. This movie - Sudden Death - is his best action film.Great action scenes, some very hilarious scenes, and great overall action and suspense make this a great action movie overall.If you like action movies, you\\'ll love this one.

James Bond 007 action film the best one that was ever made. In my opinion it is the best one I love this movie to death! I grew up watching it as a child and Pierce Brosnan is my number 1 favorite James Bond. GoldenEye is the first film to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming.I\\\\\\'m a hard-core James Bond fan. I make no apologies for believing that Pierce Brosnan is the closest thing we\\\\\\'ve seen to IAN FLEMING\\\\\\'s James Bond. The reason because it is my favorite it is because I feel it is just action, action , action and more action. I never feel bored with it, or it is too over long like some Bond movies are it is fast paced, entertaining and hard core action. The plot is simply and the story never get\\\\\\'s bored. It is a beautiful movie, with beautiful direction from Martin Campbell. The stunts are completely insane in scale in this movie and really dangerous.Music score is by Éric Serra, the title song is GoldenEye performed by Tina Turner. GoldenEye was released in 1995 after a six-year hiatus in the series caused by legal disputes, during which Timothy Dalton resigned from the role of James Bond and was replaced by Pierce Brosnan. M was also recast, with actress Judi Dench becoming the first woman to portray the character, replacing Robert Brown. The role of Miss Moneypenny was also recast, with Caroline Bliss being replaced by Samantha Bond: Desmond Llewelyn was the only actor to reprise his role, as Q. GoldenEye was the first Bond film made after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, which provided a background for the plot.Style and sophistication are in abundance - - \"The name\\\\\\'s Bond. James Bond.\" Goldeneye\\\\\\'s female characters are honestly beautiful with particular techniques. The bad one is Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), an ex-Soviet fighter pilot who tranquilly smokes big cigars and knocks off her victims with her \\\\\\'killer thighs.\\\\\\' In one scene, she challenges Bond\\\\\\'s legendary Aston Martin DB5 to a wild road race outside Monte Carlo with her red Ferrari: in another she was so smart that she snatches a top-secret helicopter from under the noses of the French navy.

His investigation leads to an organization of arms dealers Janus and the reappearance of someone from Bond\\\\\\'s past. James Bond must deal with betrayal of his old friend Alec Trevelyan (006) gone rogue, from using a satellite GoldenEye against London to cause a global financial meltdownWhy I also love this movie to death beside the action is because of the great villains who created evil characters. Such as: Sean Bean as Alec Trevelyan (006), Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp: A Georgian lust murderer, Gottfried John as General Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov and Alan Cumming as Boris Grishenko: A computer programmer.It was filmed in beautiful locations in Puerto Rico, Russia, England, UK and in the France.The movie has a lot of insane hard-core action (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), The stunts are completely insane in scale (bungee jumping in - Arkangel Chemical Weapons Facility a stunt man performed that stunt in the opening scene.) Bond with a motorcycle jumps on a plane and catches it. Bond drives a tank in Russia for the first time and he demolishes even police cars that was excellent scene. Bond a stuntman jumps out of the window in Russia. Alec Trevelyan\\\\\\'s train depot - exploding train. The epic climatic fight on the end of the movie between Bond and Trevelyan in his secret Goldeneye satellite control dish in Cuba in which Bond drops Trevelyan out of dish beautiful and really crazy stunt performance.I love the soundtracks in this movie: Goldeneye by Tina Turner and The Experience of Love by Éric Serra. I just love everything about this movie from the actions, to the heroes, to the villains from acting everything abut this movie I just love so much.GoldenEye (1995) is the seventeenth spy film in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, and the first to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 officer James Bond. The film was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to take story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming.10/10 my favorite James Bond number 1 movie. This film is amazing Totally mind-blowing I love it.\\', \"World security is in danger , ¨Janus¨ , a terrorist organization has robbed the ¨Goldeneye¨ , an ultra secret weapon system -a spy satellite- and menaced to use it for destroying a city if doesn\\'t pay and to cause a sabotage on the global financial markets . MI6 -Judi Dench as M- assigns to James Bond the mission to retrieve it . Of course , there\\'s the usual breathtaking opening scene developed in a chemist arms factory located in Siberia . There Bond and agent 006 Alec Trevelyan -Sean Bean- will have to confront against Russian military , but Alec is imprisoned by General Ourumov -Gottfried John- and at the end takes place a deadly confrontation . The film has sensational and spectacularly difficult action set pieces , as the tank pursuit in the city of Saint Petesburg or the taking on the armored train . Action is well shot , , including a groundbreaking and impressive final confrontation developed in Janus headquarter , located in Island Cuba jungle . As always , it appears Q as gadget man who teaches Bond various tools as a bomb pencil that will have special importance posteriorly , besides a speed car -BMW- equipped with rockets launchers . As Bond girls are Famke Janssen as Xena in a sensationalistic and crazed interpretation as the orgasmic to whom all risk is a emotion . Thus , she steals a super-helicopter ¨Tiger¨ and facing off opponents .Izabella Scorupco as Natalya Simanova , a computer specialist , she is marvelous and enticing with a similar countenance to Ingrid Bergman . Plus , it appears unbilled Minnie Driver . Tina Turner sings stunningly the main title and atmospheric score by Eric Serra . The film was finely directed by Martin Campbell . Rating : good and entertaining .\", \\'GOLDENEYE, the long-delayed debut of Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, was a film mired in MGM\\\\\\'s convoluted legal problems for six years, problems which had nothing to do with the 007 franchise, but which happened to fall at the worst possible time; after Timothy Dalton\\\\\\'s \\\\\\'Serious Bond\\\\\\' experiment, LICENCE TO KILL, failed to break even in U.S. markets. Despite international grosses that made the film a profitable venture, many American critics, long grumbling that the Bond series had outlasted it\\\\\\'s welcome, heaped abuse on the newer, leaner direction for \\\\\\'Bond\\\\\\', and it\\\\\\'s taciturn, less light-hearted star...and, with MGM\\\\\\'s decision to put the expensive series \\\\\\'on hold\\\\\\' until their own legal and financial issues could be resolved, LICENCE TO KILL became the unfair \\\\\\'scapegoat\\\\\\' for the delay.Much happened during the six-year hiatus; with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Communist undercurrent of many Bond films (and the subject of most of Ian Fleming\\\\\\'s novels) was lost; Richard Maibaum, the series\\\\\\' most prolific screenwriter, passed away, and ill health forced legendary producer Albert (\\\\\\'Cubby\\\\\\') Broccoli to turn over his duties to his daughter Barbara, and stepson, Michael G. Wilson (thus ending the other \\\\\\'prime\\\\\\' 007 screenwriter\\\\\\'s script contributions); many other key production figures would retire, die, or move on; and finally, as the delay continued, Timothy Dalton, nearing 50, announced that he was no longer interested in playing James Bond (sparking rumors that Eon Productions, no longer honor-bound by the senior Broccoli\\\\\\'s choices, had given him \\\\\\'the boot\\\\\\').While all this opened the door for Pierce Brosnan\\\\\\'s long-awaited debut as 007 (after his aborted first attempt, in THE LIVING DAYLIGHTS), with a new \\\\\\'look\\\\\\' and style for the franchise, whether audiences would even accept a new \\\\\\'James Bond\\\\\\' adventure was in doubt. Fortunately, everything \\\\\\'worked\\\\\\'. Brosnan, now 42, was more ruggedly believable as 007 than he would have been, at 34, and Dame Judi Dench, as the first woman \\\\\\'M\\\\\\' (referring to Bond as a \"sexist, misogynist dinosaur\"), proved a perfect successor to the late Bernard Lee. While the plot of the film, involving the master plan of a renegade Russian General (Gottfried John) and an assumed dead 006 (Sean Bean) to use an electronic warfare system (GoldenEye) against England was nothing new, Brosnan\\\\\\'s daring-do and one-liners (with humor restored to the franchise), as he proved his value in the new world \\\\\\'order\\\\\\', found an audience \\\\\\'primed\\\\\\' for James Bond\\\\\\'s return...and the welcome cameo of the series\\\\\\' last original \\\\\\'regular\\\\\\', \"Q\" (Desmond Llewelyn, 81, and as cranky as ever), cemented 007\\\\\\'s links to both the past and the future.James Bond\\\\\\'s greatest crisis, whether he still had \\\\\\'Box Office\\\\\\', had been overcome, and with audience favorite Pierce Brosnan in place, his emergence into the 21st century was assured.\\', \"GoldenEye is entertainment, not as classy as some of those before, but among the very best in the series.Perhaps the greatest portrayal of the lead character, with Brosnan and certainly the best opening sequence. There\\'s no way he could make it, heh. The first half much better than the second, they all seem to go on and on though. The Bond girl Scorupco, one of the weakest. However Janssen makes up for it, taking the whole Grace Jones villainess role to another level. Bean an excellent counterpart as well. The secondary characters all decent, could do without Dench though. The song by Tina Turner, outstanding.Alec: For England, James? Bond: No. For me!\", \"One of my favourite quotes from this film you know. As for GoldenEye, I consider it the best of the Pierce Brosnan Bond films. Pierce Brosnan makes for a great and likable title character, and Judi Dench is rock-solid as always as M. Izabella Scorupco is a splendid Natalya and I loved feisty Xenia, marvellously played by Famke Janssen, who kills her victims by crushing them between her thighs, while Janus is wonderfully mysterious as a villain. Technically, GoldenEye can\\'t be faulted either. The cinematography is beautiful, while the locations are superb and the stunts perfectly done especially the car chase through the streets of St Petersburg. The music and theme song are very memorable too, the pacing is brisk and the script and plot are well intact. GoldenEye mayn\\'t be the best Bond film ever, but it is for me one of the more enjoyable ones. 9/10 Bethany Cox\", \\'This film is the best of the classic James Bond films, i.e. those before the Daniel Craig reboot. It hits the right tone where it is not too serious but also not too silly either. The pacing is exciting and Pierce Brosnan is classy as always.\\', \"The James Bond franchise, in cinematic terms, began in 1962 with Dr No. There followed a Bond movie every couple of years or so (the longest gap between two 007 films was the three-year-hiatus separating The Man With The Golden Gun - 1974 - and The Spy Who Loved Me - 1977). Then, in 1989, with the release of Licence To Kill the series seemed to die. The box office returns of that film were disappointing; the then-Bond actor Timothy Dalton was axed; the film itself was presented in a grittier, more adult style than fans were accustomed to; and various legal wranglings put the Bond character into limbo. Six long years went by without a Bond movie and many insiders predicted an end for the British super-spy and his outrageous screen adventures. Too much time had gone by, they said, no-one was interested any longer in the character or the stories. But then Goldeneye came along, with Pierce Brosnan as Bond - it went on to become a commercial hit, propelling its star into the A-list and reinvigorating the entire series.James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) and his secret agent colleague Alec Trevelyan (Sean Bean) infiltrate a Russian military installation on a sabotage mission. During the mission, Alec is apparently killed by the enemy forces but Bond manages a miraculous escape. Several years later, a state-of-the-art helicopter is stolen from the West by some Russian spies and used to destroy a Siberian satellite station. When Bond investigates, he discovers to his surprise that the plot involves his old colleague Alec - who is very much alive, having faked his death in the earlier exchange. Trevelyan\\'s plan is to get control of a powerful satellite called the Goldeneye and to use it to destroy a designated target on Earth - in this case, London. It emerges that his parents were Liensk Cossacks, brutally killed by the British when he was a boy, and he has long plotted a way to have his revenge. Bond teams up with a Russian computer programmer, Natalya Semyonova (Isabella Scorupco) and pursues Trevelyan around the globe in an effort to stop his sinister scheme. The trail leads to Cuba, where Trevelyan has a secret lair from which he is on the very brink of unleashing chaos upon the world.... unless 007 can find a way to thwart him.Goldeneye begins with a truly outrageous stunt involving Bond freefalling in pursuit of an unpiloted, plummeting airplane. This dumb but enjoyable scene sets the tone for the rest of the film - very much a tongue-in-cheek, improbable, action-orientated romp. Brosnan is OK as Bond, though I still feel Sean Connery and Roger Moore were slightly better suited to the role. Tina Turner\\'s powerful theme song is very good, but the incidental scoring by Eric Serra has a tinny, tacky feel to it that makes one long for John Barry! As the bad guy, Sean Bean is effective enough even if he never quite matches the memorableness of the all-time great Bond villains (eg Dr No, Oddjob, Blofeld, Francisco Scaramanga). The Bond girls are very good in this one - Scorupco plays a pleasingly resourceful character, while Famke Janssen has great fun as a female baddie who crushes victims between her thighs. Goldeneye is by no means the best of the Bond series, but one has to be thankful to it for getting the dormant series up and running once more. And, in its pacy, breakneck way, it is undeniably a lot of fun.\", \\'Pierce Brosnan was the best looking and least likable of the six actors to play 007 for the Eon production team. No film demonstrates this better than this, his first.It\\\\\\'s a new decade for James Bond. Now he works for a woman, has to be evaluated for mental fitness, and with the fall of the Soviet Union must rely on the friendship of old enemies not to mention the enmity of old friends. All this comes into play when he is sent to discover the reason for an explosion at a Russian satellite monitoring station.When \"GoldenEye\" came out, more than six years had passed since the last Bond movie. Many wondered if time had passed James by. The movie plays this up when Bond is called a \"sexist, misogynistic dinosaur\" by his new M (Judi Dench). Bond seems unfazed by this, and everything else.\"Trick is to quit while you\\\\\\'re still ahead,\" says his most charming adversary in this adventure, Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen).\"That\\\\\\'s one trick I\\\\\\'ve never learned,\" Bond replies.Brosnan looks fantastic in the action sequences, better than any Bond before him, and his James Coburn-like grin rivals Connery\\\\\\'s smirk and Moore\\\\\\'s raised eyebrow for a facial signature. Too bad his overall smugness gets in the way. Here\\\\\\'s one Bond you actually root against, especially when pitted against Onatopp. Employing missionary zeal if not position in her quest for the perfect kill, Onatopp is one of Bond\\\\\\'s most memorable adversaries, and a riot as played by the brave Janssen.Also helping matters a lot is the film\\\\\\'s other Bond girl, Izabella Scorupco, and a nifty title song from Tina Turner written by Bono and The Edge that captures the spirit if not the sound of 1960s Bond movies. Q (Desmond Llewelyn) gets off some good lines.What loses me about this movie most is the second half, where a once-taut and plausible story (well, except for Bond jumping off a cliff and into an airplane) gives way to a lot of nonsense where Bond drives a tank through St. Petersburg and outraces a speeding train. Crazy visuals are one thing, but Bond kills more Russians in this movie than he did in the whole series up to this point, and many of them are innocent patriots who merely get in his way. So much for the end of the Cold War!Director Martin Campbell, who would go on to unretire Bond more effectively a second time in the later \"Casino Royale\", fashions a clean visual look that gives the action sequences added oomph. There\\\\\\'s some wheat among the chaff in terms of dialogue, though the writers overdo the humor probably trying to compensate for the previous Bond, Timothy Dalton, whose sober mien was (unfairly) criticized by many. Let\\\\\\'s just say that our first image of Brosnan as Bond shouldn\\\\\\'t be of him hanging upside down in a toilet stall, but it is.The Brosnan of \"GoldenEye\" presents us with a good actor and an electric screen presence, but he lacks the occasional deferential quality other Bond actors had; the ability to look at his situation with an encouraging shrug or wink that allowed you to feel some kind of bond with him. Brosnan\\\\\\'s about coolness and distance, which detract somewhat from the generally decent \"GoldenEye\", and would become more of a problem in time.\\']',\n",
              "       '[\"Aaron Sorkin sets a snappy pace for this classic romance/comedy/Cinderella Story, utilizing the White House, the President, and his staff as the conduit for his dialogue writing prowess.Clearly, this film helped influence the creation of The West Wing four years later, even using the same Oval Office set shown in this film. The sets and atmosphere are presented in immaculate detail, and authentic looking, surpassing anything ever portrayed in film other than the Whitehouse itself. I\\'ve been in the real Whitehouse, including the Oval Office, and have also sat at the faux Resolute desk on the set of West Wing (same desk used in this film). There was a tremendous investment made to recreate the real thing in this film, and Reiner pulled it off perfectly.In Sorkin\\'s screenplays, self-confidence, keen intellect, superior communication ability, and one\\'s ethics-compass are at the core of the protagonist\\'s persona.Michael Douglas portrays Democratic President Andrew Shepherd with the same believability and deft touch as he did playing Gordon Gecko in Wall Street.Annette Benning is the ideal girlfriend of the widowed Shepherd, and engages the audience (and Douglas) in one of her most charming performances.A first-class supporting actor ensemble are up to the task of portraying Sorkin\\'s crack White House staff, adding immensely to making this film a feel-good romance that is believable and fun.The plot doesn\\'t delve deeply into the emotions or feelings of Shepard nor Benning\\'s lobbyist charecter Sydney Ellen Wade, but highlights the witty repertoire one would expect from a US President and Capitol Hill lobbyist. The deft skill and movie-star quality each actor has developed in their respective acting careers are showcased with Sorkin\\'s writing in telling this Whitehouse Cinderella story.If the film went deep into emotions, it would have just gotten in the way of a story of a widowed relatively young President falling in love at first sight with Sydney, and the fun of seeing her being thrust into the White House staff and press fish bowl.There is a definite Frank Capra influence to the film.It all works better than it might seem on paper, and we get to enjoy another Rob Reiner classic: A director whose movie-making style and subject-matter is as diverse as anyone in the business.\", \\'One of the greatest movie finale speeches ever, literal chills. The american president has always been a favorite of mine. The characters are well acted and quite lovely. The storyline is unique and has a good mix of heartfelt and comical. Endlessly rewatchable.\\', \\'The American President (1995)What a smart, fast, feel-good movie about American politics and the power of the presidency. And how unlikely (these thing don\\\\\\'t usually go together).What makes it work? Everything! I know deep down that this isn\\\\\\'t a masterpiece, a Citizen Kane or Godfather kind of movie. But it is in its own way perfect. It\\\\\\'s funny as can be--endlessly witty or sarcastic or actually cleverly funny. It\\\\\\'s acted to a T, including of course the two leads, Michael Douglas in his alpha male with a personable side and Annette Bening in her utterly charming and disarmingly sharp warmth.It\\\\\\'s almost impossible to appreciate the huge list of side characters who are first rate through and through, even in their very brief roles. Richard Dreyfuss might be the least of these since he plays an obvious stereotype. Michael J. Fox is funny and quick and Martin Sheen is quasi-presidential as he needs to be since of course (via \"West Wing\") he later becomes the president.But not here. This is the story of Douglas and Bening. It presages the excellent British version , in its own way, \"Love Actually,\" with Hugh Grant and an equally big cast of excellent extras, but that was more purely feel-good (or feel-incredibly-good) and this one eight years earlier actually has a political axe to grind.In fact, I\\\\\\'m going to guess that one reason for the slightly deflated ratings is the conservative audience didn\\\\\\'t really like what the president stands for here, and though it is just a movie, it\\\\\\'s easier to root for the cast when they tend to agree with you. And agree in emphatic eloquent ways. There is a speech Douglas (as president) gives toward the end that comes out and boldly takes a simple stand for decent liberal values. He\\\\\\'s confident, clear, and unwavering. And if you agree with that kind of thing (I do) you want to say hurrah.And you want our own darned president to say what he believes so simply and with such firmness.Of course, all of this is simplified and made too easy. Luckily it\\\\\\'s not only about politics. In fact it\\\\\\'s a comedy or manners, you might say, the protocol of who to behave with and near the president being fodder for great laughs just as much as the Victorian plays and movies had fun with the same twists of expectations. No wonder it morphed into a hit television series--though oddly enough the humor gets minimized. Maybe the same kinds of jokes wear themselves out.Rob Reiner is maybe our most astute politically astute director, at least when there is a sense of humor required. He cut his teeth in every way with the best, working with and under Norman Lear in years of shooting (and performing, as \"Meathead\") in \"All in the Family.\" It shows here. He has a real knack for timing, for turning absurdity to wit, and for warmth. (He probably got some of that from the Smothers Brothers, too.) If you like this don\\\\\\'t stop here--Reiner has many other good or possibly great movies, many getting better reviews than this one.But here we have \"The American President,\" deceptively simple in its title. This is above all a really cozy movie. You want to watch, and you want to be there. At least for a couple hours.I sound foolish liking this silly movie too much, but there you have it.\\', \"Is there a genre that Rob Reiner can\\'t work in and make successful?  He captured comedy beautifully with The Sure Thing.  Music was brilliant with This is Spinal Tap.  Horror?  How about Misery?  Courtroom drama was awesome with A Few Good Men.  And now we have a political drama/comedy.  There is nothing this man can\\'t do.This movie works inspite of people\\'s claims that it is too political.  Well you know what, it\\'s about the president of the United States of America, there\\'s going to be a bit of poiltics in it.  And guess what, guns do kill people, so to have an issue at hand here that deals with gun control is applaudable.Okay, that\\'s out of the way, let\\'s talk about the film itself.  Because it is wonderful.  It is funny, well acted, and it is written with a good ear.The cast in this film is one to be envied by almost everyone except Oliver Stone and Robert Altman who seem to get everyone to do their films.  But here we have Douglas as the president, Sheen as his aid, Michael J. Fox, Samantha Mathis, Annette Bening as Sydney Ellen Wade and in my favourite performance, Richard Dreyfuss as the sniveling weasle Senator Bob Rumsen.As the story goes, the president\\'s character gets questioned when he ( a widow ) finds a girlfriend in Sydney Wade.  The issues are handled wonderfully here.  Nothing is really tip-toed around as the script writer ( Aaron Sorkin ) writes a brave script about what is right and wrong with being the president and having a girlfriend.I personally liked the politics in the film.  I enjoyed how Shepherd decides to ignore the critisism leveled at him until the very end when he gives one of the best written speeches I\\'ve ever seen in film.  And when he flexes his authoritative muscles, you feel his power, you feel that the president has spoken.  And I was moved.  This is a great film and one that should be checked out for sure.****  I also found it to be interesting that the character in the film that tries to get the issue of gun control brought to the forefront is Michael J. Fox.  He is Canadian and we don\\'t have problems with guns here.  Is it a coincidence ( probably ) that he was chosen to play this role?  Or was it done deliberately?  Interesting.\", \\'US President Andrew Shepherd is a widower who was sweep into power on the back of great public sympathy.  Three years into his presidency he meets and falls for Sydney Ellen Wade, an environmental lobbyist.  Eventually they begin to date against the counsel of his advisors, giving his rivals (most notably Senator Rumson) and the media the ammunition they need to begin to attack his presidency.This is not exactely a political thriller.  In fact it is as far removed from reality as you could imagine.  However that\\\\\\'s the point, this film doesn\\\\\\'t pretend to be anything other than a romantic comedy - it has some political wranglings but it is very far from the (still very tidy and clean) rule of Martin Sheen\\\\\\'s President in TV\\\\\\'s The West Wing.  However the story is nicely handled and Rob Reiner is natually very good at this type of thing.  Here it occasionally is far too sickly sweet and sentimental, but most of it works well.Douglas is good in the lead and looks quite acceptable as the President of the US - lets be honest, if it was him or \"oil baron\" Bush who would you pick?  Bening is also good as Sydney but neither have anything outside of the usual romantic leads to do.  The real strength here is the supporting cast - both in terms of class and sheer enterainment value.To name a few - Sheen, MJ Fox, Mathis, Dreyfuss - all big names, all funny performances.Overall this is a big sloppy romantic comedy, but it\\\\\\'s done with so much class that it\\\\\\'s hard not to like it.  Not brillant, but very enjoyable all the same.\\', \"This is a great feel good movie about a charismatic, essentially very decent, fictional U.S. President, played by Michael Douglas in an extremely likable role. It\\'s a political story as well as a love story. Douglas is both commanding & assured in his presidential role and charming & endearing in his romantic role. If anyone has not yet seen this movie, you\\'ll discover you\\'re in for an unexpected treat. There\\'s something here for everyone...romance, comedy, politics, and drama. Andrew Shepherd is a youngish, popular President soon up for re election. Pressure is being put to bear on him to consolidate his administration\\'s high poll ratings by pushing through a moderate crime bill which totally lacks Republican party support, yet is considered too weak by the Democrats. Meanwhile he finds himself attracted to Sydney Wade, an environmental lobbyist who is seeking legislation to reduce carbon monoxide emissions. Shepherd has been widowed for three years, and currently needs an escort for a State Dinner in honour of the President of France. He invites Sydney to this function and during this & subsequent encounters, the pair fall in love. Trouble ensues when Shepherd is torn between the politically expedient crime bill and the environmental legislation he has promised his new love interest. In terms of romance, there is the ongoing love story between the widowed President and the young lobbyist, Sydney, charmingly played by Annette Benning. This lovely and intelligent lady is quite smitten but at first obviously a bit overwhelmed by it all, feeling awkward and uncertain as the President\\'s date. Sydney looks absolutely radiant at the state ball as she is swept off her feet by this handsome leader of the free world. Their chemistry proves to be electric, the dialogue clever, and the potential sexual situations quite tasteful by modern standards. Naturally the course of true love never does run smooth so it goes without saying that additionally, this unusual fishbowl courtship would have some unique problems as politics and public opinion intrude upon the couple\\'s personal life.A certain built in comedy natural for a dating President makes this romance all the more enchanting. For instance, when Andrew attempts to buy his sweetheart some roses, can\\'t you just imagine the national crisis that all but ensues? Despite his position as Head of State, Andrew likes to do his courting the old fashioned, personal way. During his initial phone call to Sydney, she believes he\\'s one of her friends pulling a prank, which of course results in some hilarity.Naturally this tale is ripe with politics, and some reviewers even claim that the film is something of a precursor to TV\\'s West Wing. Shepherd faces the dilemma of being forced to choose between the crime bill that his party is after him to push, versus Sydney\\'s particular environmental cause. Not only party politics, but there is waning public support to consider. Needless to say, the President has no lack of advisers around who are more than eager to state their views, giving at times unsolicited advice. Martin Sheen plays his Chief of Staff and Michael J. Fox is cast as his Domestic Policy adviser. Shepherd must also contend with mud slinging by a nasty, unscrupulous rival Senator (portrayed by Richard Dreyfuss), who calls into question both Shepherd\\'s family values and his girlfriend\\'s activist past. By the way, any liberal political bias presented in this movie proved totally inoffensive to me. I definitely didn\\'t sense that the producers had a nefarious grand agenda here.Drama wise, there\\'s a touching, close relationship depicted between the President and his charming young teenage daughter, Lucy, and a definite sense of his loneliness following the death of his wife from cancer. Also, Shepherd is confronted with the choice of keeping his promise to Sydney versus salvaging his political career. His Oval Office moral dilemmas are not only relevant to the Presidency but can be extrapolated to any person in any career.This film delivers a powerful message about both personal and presidential integrity. At one point there\\'s a moving speech that is inspiring for anyone, but may give American viewers in particular cause for reflection about the real significance of their country\\'s Presidency and the qualities they might want to look for in the person elected to that office. Personally, I was practically ready to start flying the Stars and Stripes and I\\'m not even American! Whatever the nation involved, pity we don\\'t have more Andrew Shepherds in political life today.\", \"The writing is sharp, though you can tell Sorkin hadn\\'t quite mastered his style. The story is actually pretty reasonable and makes for an interesting film. Michael Douglas is excellent as the president and you can see the model from which Sorkin would craft Josiah Bartlet. All in all, this is a decent diversion and I enjoyed most of it.\", \\'Okay, without a doubt this is one of my favorite romantic comedies. Michael Douglas comes off as Presidential, Annette Benning is spectacular, Martin Sheen is exceptional, and the supporting cast is marvelous. And this is all directed by Rob Reiner, the 2nd generation actor writer director who understands every aspect of film making and is not afraid to let loose with all the knowledge, power and presence required to make a first class film. Of particular note are David Paymer, Michael J. Fox, and Anna Deavere Smith, all three exceptional character actors whose contributions add so much to the texture and tone of the film. Paymer is the perfect foil to Fox, and Anna balances them perfectly, giving a unity to the staff presence in the film. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the film is the incorporation of \\\\\\'normal\\\\\\' events in the White House during the romance. We are not excluded or merely \"clued in\", but we participate in all the activities of the President, which makes the film more realistic and visceral. The flow of the film is exceptional, since there are no explosions or other violence to distract us, and the cinematography is amazing. The sets are perfect. Rated PG-13 for a scene of sexual innuendo and a few uses of profanity, this film is far from offensive in its delivery, its demeanor, or its presentation. A classic which will enhance any collection.\\', \\'I don\\\\\\'t mean that as a slam. I like Pretty Woman a lot, too. But this movie is my \"cure for all ills\" movie. The one I throw in the DVD player on rainy Sunday afternoons and crack out my best junk food. And the political setting seems to give it more meat.Michael Douglas is perfect. Annette Benning is perfect (and I would give anything to look as beautiful as she does in that blue dress at the State Dinner). Michael J. Fox, Martin Sheen, Anna Devoure Smith. People being passionate about each other and about important issues and about doing the right thing. Everything about this movie lifts me up when I\\\\\\'m feeling down.\\\\nI\\\\\\'m not a liberal, and I\\\\\\'m not a conservative - I fall somewhere in the middle. My beliefs in gun control to not include \"(getting) the guns\". But this movie is so good - that I can look past the occasional differences in political views. Those views are presented in a smart, thoughtful and constructive manner - and I appreciate them even though they are not my own.\\\\nI enjoy this movie for what it is - a sweet, smart, funny movie set in one of the most \"romantic\" settings in the world - The White House.\\']',\n",
              "       '[\"Mel Brooks, one of my favorite directors of all time, he\\'s delivered some of the most memorable comedies: Young Frankenstein, Spaceballs, The Producers, High Anxiety, Blazing Saddles, Robin Hood: Men in Tights. He now brings us Dracula: Dead and Loving it, one of my favorite guilty pleasures. I know there is a bit of hate for this movie because a lot of people say that Mel lost his touch and this isn\\'t as funny as his older films. Let\\'s face it, Mel peeked pretty early in his career with Young Frankenstein, which is one of my favorite films of all time, but everyone is naturally going to compare every film that he made at that point with his greatest movies. But if you seriously are telling me that there was not one scene that you didn\\'t laugh at then you need your funny bone checked.The year is 1893, solicitor Thomas Renfield travels all the way from London to Transylvania to meet an important client. As he nears the end of his journey, the sun sets, and the stagecoach driver refuses to take him any further. Kindly villagers plead with him to turn back, but Renfield explains that he is expected. Renfield arrives safely and meets Count Dracula, a charming but rather strange man who is, of course, a vampire. Dracula signs the papers finalizing the purchase of Carfax Abbey in England, and Renfield retires for the night. He wakes up when two Brides of Dracula come gliding seductively in. Dracula then casts a hypnotic spell on the suggestible Renfield, making him his slave. Dracula and Renfield soon embark for England. He goes ashore, leaving Renfield behind. When Renfield is discovered alone on the ship, he is confined to a lunatic asylum. Dracula introduces himself to his new neighbors: Doctor Seward, owner of the asylum where Renfield is being held, and a believer in enemas as a sovereign remedy for mental illness; Seward\\'s assistant, Jonathan Harker; Seward\\'s beautiful daughter Mina; and Seward\\'s ward, the equally pretty Lucy. Dracula flirts with Lucy and, later that night, he feeds on her blood. The next day, Mina discovers Lucy still in bed late in the morning, looking strangely pale. Seward, puzzled by the odd puncture marks on her throat, calls in an expert on obscure diseases, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. Van Helsing is convinced that Dracula is a vampire and that they must destroy him before he gets to Mina next.Dracula: Dead and Loving It may be a bit silly at times, but seriously, you can\\'t help but laugh. It\\'s certainly a lot better then most spoof movies today. How could you not love Leslie Nielson as Dracula? He was so hilarious, but who truly stole the show? Peter MacNicol as Reinfield, I can\\'t tell you how hard he made me laugh, if one laugh supposedly makes you loose 3 calories, I think I lost 15,000 calories with just his scenes. Reinfield being seduced by Dracula\\'s brides, him trying to save Dracula\\'s coffin on the ship from hitting the walls back and forth, him sneaking under Lucy\\'s bed sheets to peak at her, to the ending, actually every scene with him is non stop laughs. I don\\'t care what people think, I\\'m not comparing, I think this is a very funny movie and is just a blast to watch, if you don\\'t laugh while watching this movie, you\\'re not invited to my parties, you party pooper! 8/10\", \\'This Dracula spoof has many original laughs along the way. After all the recent Vampire movies it\\\\\\'s even more funny.Typical Mel Brooks humor is laugh out loud and crude. The cast is good including Amy Yasbeck as Mina and Leslie Nielsen as Dracula. Mel himself plays Van Helsing. Peter Macnicol is good too as Dracula\\\\\\'s helper. Love the mock English accents and the way they pronounce \"Lucy\".It\\\\\\'s not as original as Young Frankenstein or as ribald as History of the World but it\\\\\\'s got enough laughs. Surprised to find out it had bad reviews and wasn\\\\\\'t a hit. Definitely worth a watch. I am a Mel Brooks fan and this one is about in the middle of the range.\\', \\'This was another entertaining Mel Brooks farce, a la Young Frankenstein and Blazing Saddles. If you liked those, you\\\\\\'d like this.Peter MacNichol almost steals the show in this film as \"Renfield.\" He just drives me buggy. Leslie Nielsen, who revived his career later in life playing goofy roles, also is very good, this time as \\\\\\'Dracula.\" Actually, I thought he was far better in here than in those other spoofs, such as the \"Naked Gun\" series. It may be his best comedic role.The two women in here, Amy Yasback and Lysette Anthony, are beautiful, and well-endowed as Brooks - and a lot of us guys - likes \\\\\\'em. They are in the film for their looks while the other two provide the laughs.Story-wise, it\\\\\\'s just a light-hearted look at the story of Dracula, told many times in the films, mostly in the serious vein (pun intended) except for \"Love At First Bite\" which was similar in laughs to this. After watching this film, I could never look at garlic or blood the same way!When you need some good laughs and nothing else, this will fill the need for an hour-and-a-half.\\', \\'I remember being an 11 year old boy in stitches with laughter when I first viewed this film on new release VCR (yeah, video - old school)!Having just watched this film again recently I have to say that it\\\\\\'s still just as funny as it was as a child. The film of course is a parody on the \\\\\\'Dracula\" mythos and the jokes and gags are much better understood if you\\\\\\'ve watched films such as \"Bram Stoker\\\\\\'s: Dracula\" which I can\\\\\\'t watch seriously anymore cos\\\\\\' I constantly think of this film in certain scenes and start laughing! The cast is brilliant in their roles especially Leslie Neilsen as \"Dracula\" and his brain-washed slave \"Renfield\" (Peter MacNicol) portraying an insane, insect eating madman extraordinarily well!The humour is all in the typical Mel Brooks \\\\\\'tongue-in-cheek\\\\\\' style and also quite reminiscent of Monty Python in parts, the over-the-top British accents may attribute to that part.The final film directed by Mel Brooks, \"Dracula Dead and Loving It\" is very entertaining and the mindless humour make for a very enjoyable spoof movie!Highly recommended : )\\', \\'While this skewering of the Dracula mythology and the various cinematic interpretations of the story never achieves the kind of crazy heights of \"Blazing Saddles\" or \"Young Frankenstein\", it still shows that Brooks still had it in him to come up with some great, gut busting scenes. Being a genuine horror fan as well as a comedy legend, he and his team of collaborators do go to great lengths to give this film the proper look, and it\\\\\\'s a colourful, stylish looking movie, going with the idea that the composer wasn\\\\\\'t in on the joke and featuring a score by Hummie Mann that\\\\\\'s full of foreboding. Leslie Nielsen is the pratfalling prince of darkness who is set up quite well early on when he comments on the \"Children of the Night\" and \"the mess they make\" - and then promptly slips in such a mess. He\\\\\\'s a delight as always, with wonderful support by a bunch of actors who mug for all they\\\\\\'re worth, especially Peter MacNicol as the loony, bug munching Renfield and veteran Brooks colleague Harvey Korman, who in his performance as Dr. Seward, does an amusing impression of the actor Nigel Bruce. Brooks himself, in fine hammy form, plays the part of the intrepid Van Helsing. Lysette Anthony and Amy Yasbeck are both quite ravishing as Lucy and Mina respectively, with Steven Weber as a prudish and uptight Jonathan Harker, and Mark Blankfield, Megan Cavanagh, and Clive Revill doing well in smaller roles. Cameos include Avery Schreiber, Chuck McCann, co-screenwriter Rudy De Luca, Charlie Callas, and the wonderful Anne Bancroft paying tribute to Maria Ouspenskaya in her brief bit. Standout scenes include the staking of Lucy (Van Helsing stays well out of the way for good reason), the breakfast sequence with MacNicol and Korman, which is particularly priceless, and the scene where Dracula is trying to manipulate both Mina and Essie and not having much success. A snappily paced movie leading to a fairly big finish, \"Dracula: Dead and Loving It\" is good entertainment as Brooks comedies go, and even gives its principal cast members the kind of \"curtain call\" at the end that we don\\\\\\'t see in movies that often. Seven out of 10.\\', \"Renfield set out to find Count Dracula in Transylvania, and it was immediately clear from people\\'s reactions that this would be a funny movie. Eventually, Renfield and Dracula ended up on a ship, and in England, Dracula began causing problems for Dr. Seward, the man running an asylum, and his daughters. Renfield was apparently Dracula\\'s servant by this time. Dr. Van Helsing was called in to find out what was going on.I like this kind of comedy. It wasn\\'t \\'Naked Gun\\' or \\'Airplane!\\' but Leslie Nielsen, Harvey Korman and Mel Brooks were very good given the material. I didn\\'t care for the blood and gore, but sometimes the gore was not violent, just silly. Some highlights:When one hypnotizes someone, that person must be sure that when he says to forget everything you\\'ve been told by the hypnotist, that this applies only after you have done what the hypnotist said to do. Dracula did not.Dracula hypnotized Mina and Essie at the same time.One person who turned into a vampire had to be killed for good with a stake.I\\'m not saying whether this was accomplished, only that the attempt was hilarious.\\'Oh, yes, we have Nosferatu.\\'Dracula danced in front of a mirror. Great special effects, good choreography since the partner had to know what to do alone.\", \\'\"Dracula: Dead and Loving It\" is a movie that seems to define what someone either really likes or dislikes about a comedy, and more specifically a parody: gags.  For me, the gags herein worked, there were reasons for their having been used and therefore makes it funny to me.  The storyline didn\\\\\\'t stall, the gags weren\\\\\\'t desperate for laughs, and the acting was exactly what was needed: the comedic touch.  The casting choice to have Steven Weber and Amy Yasbeck, both veterans of the TV series \"Wings\", was brilliant because the chemistry between their personalities was proven and honed before the movie.  The choice of Leslie Nielsen for the titular role was dead-on.  Someone that has the wisdom of centuries (decades, whatever), is cunning (a la the Naked Gun series), and above all, never gives up (until turned to dust).  Mel Brooks, having proved his comedic prowess with films like \"Young Frankenstein\", comes through in the role of Van Helsing.  Even the incidental characters seem to have a reason to belong and flow in the movie, like Essie, the guardian of Mina, or Martin, Dr. Seward\\\\\\'s right-hand man of the sanitarium...Martin:  \"...the patient in the west wing?  He\\\\\\'s havin\\\\\\' a conniption fit.\"Dr. Seward:  \"Oh.  Give him an enima.\"As stated, the movie will most likely be quite funny or very dull, depending on what the viewer expects from it beforehand.  Being that I like a good slapstick comedy (and I do), the performances above all are what were able to pull me in.FOOSH-TAA!\"Dracula: Dead and Loving It\" gets 9 of 10 stars\\', \"Mel Brooks\\'s scattergun approach to comedy has a number of misses. Spaceballs was OK at parodying its genre. This film is far more sophisticated and well played.The successful jokes are on the culture of Victorain times with references to an engaged couple who after 10 years have suddenly held hands being condemned as immoral, prostitutes, lechers and the like. Into these cultural and successful observations Brook\\'s introduces Leslie Nielson doing a great impression of Bela Lugosi\\'s Dracula with the difference that his powers are incompetent.Seeing the Lugosi movie will give you the basis to appreciate the sophistication of this film.\", \\'This comedy followed the Bram Stoker book very closely. It merely turned the whole tale into a hilarious romp, making fun of Dracula and his inept sidekick, Renfield, as well as the other characters. A lot of slapstick gags in this film, some I saw coming from a mile off, but I still got a kick out of them. I especially liked the scene where Van Helsing and Harker staked the vampire in the tomb - what a riot. Neilson was great as the troubled bloodsucker.\\']',\n",
              "       '[\"This is a great children\\'s movie. But, being a kid\\'s movie doesn\\'t mean that it isn\\'t good for others. This film entertains audiences of all ages. I first saw this movie when I was seven. And to this day, I still love it. Kevin Bacon supplies the voice of Balto, a half-bred wolf who risks his life to travel in the cold of Alaska to retrieve a sled of dogs that were lost while bringing antibiodics back to the town of Nome to stop an epidemic. BALTO is a film to see on a cold, Sunday when you have nothing better to do. You will enjoy this film greatly. After viewing it once, you will want to see it again. I lost track of how many times I have seen this film. But it has been more than thirty times. See this movie. It\\'s well worth seeing. This one is one that I am proud to have in my video collection.....5/5.\", \"This film has a seriousness and drama to it that will surprise you. There are no songs, and it has an adult feel to it, with mature themes and exciting action. The voice characters are its main failing, with Kevin Bacon giving rather flat performance to Balto, and there is an overall lack of conviction in most of the other voices as well.  But this movie has good story and excellent pacing- there are several gripping action sequences, and very few childish moments. Balto is an excellent family film, and will keep adults and older kids enthralled and entertained.  I think it\\'s a little too serious for very young kids to enjoy, though.  It has realism and is not light hearted. There are ideas about sickness, death and prejudice which are used very well to move this story along and help resolve it in the end. This is a hero story with a feel-good ending, and plenty of adventure along the way.  The art and appearance is interesting and unique, mostly classic animation with a few computer assisted scenes-- the overall look is tidy and quality, with some charm and humor that will get you smiling.  It has a live action entry and closure (including a view of the Balto statue in Central Park) which acts as a tie-together, and the true story behind this movie gives it additional appeal. This film, like the WB\\'s \\'Iron Giant\\', has been breezed over by the public and not gotten the recognition it deserves. I would recommend Balto for anyone who likes dogs, realism, or just a smooth, enjoyable film.\", \\'It\\\\\\'s not hard to see why this movie wasn\\\\\\'t particularly popular (check out the scene where the carpenter is shown sadly preparing small coffins), but that doesn\\\\\\'t mean it isn\\\\\\'t worth a look.  It\\\\\\'s actually one of the best underrated animated films of the 90\\\\\\'s.  The drama is real, the visuals are beautiful, and the story ends happily.  The live action prologue and epilogue are a little distracting, but they\\\\\\'re made up for by a random (and hilarious) visual shout-out to \"E.T.\"\\', \"I can completely understand why people love this movie, because while for me it isn\\'t the greatest animated movie ever(Beauty and the Beast gets that honour I\\'m afraid), it is a pretty darn good movie. It is certainly quite powerful and ambitious, and there are parts that tug at the heartstrings. The film isn\\'t laden with humour as much as something like The Lion King or Castle of Cagliostro, but with the characters Boris, Muk and Luk it is evident.The animation is surprisingly detailed. Critics complained of the animation quality being dull and tacky, and when I saw that I thought did we see the same movie. The colours were fine, maybe not the most vibrant colouring in the world like FernGully for instance, but the character animation and the backgrounds are immaculate. The music by James Horner, one of my favourite film composers, is outstanding. Maybe not his finest, as he has done some amazing scores, the one he did for Land Before Time really packs an emotional punch even on repeated viewing, but it is very powerful, poignant and haunting all at the same time and even enhances the drama.Then there are the characters. Balto is a lovable and handsome dog, and Jenna is so beautiful and headstrong. In contrast, we have Boris who is hilarious and Steele a villain detestable in quite a substantial way. The voice acting is very good, Kevin Bacon while an unlikely choice initially does an above decent job, not monotonic or bland like some other celebrities who have voiced in animated films. Bob Hoskins gives great comic relief as Boris, and Phil Collins is amusing as Muk and Luk. Bridget Fonda does well as Jenna, but I have to say Jim Cummings is absolutely BRILLIANT as Steele; Cummings is a very underrated veteran voice actor, and his malevolent voice over proves what talent as a voice actor he has.The film does have an engaging, sometimes tense sometimes heartwarming story, and while perhaps in need of a little more humour, the script wasn\\'t actually that bad. All in all, very overlooked as an animated film. 10/10 Bethany Cox\", \"Where can I start? This movie is greatly animated, directed and written. There\\'s no cheesy songs to slow it up or a boring storyline. Every angle that is shown is perfect, every background and colour scheme is great. The music by James Horner is well done and fits the moods of the film. Whether you\\'re a kid or an adult, you will find yourself cheering Balto on.\", \\'Balto & his friends, Boris, Muk, Luk & Jenna are characters to capture the heart. Romance, humour & determination lead us on an epic adventure through the snow. The voicing is excellent and the soundtrack is too. Steele is a good villain. There are some impressive animated sequences especially with the wolves & the bear. An overlooked masterpiece. 10/10\\', \"It is only my opinion, but this was probably one of the best animated movies I have ever viewed. I cannot understand why someone could disagree against this movie. Character voicing was superb, full of life and very well constructed. Aniamtion was beautiful, with smooth backgrounds and even up to the little details such as footprints left behind in the snow. The music was probably the best part of all, with the excellent orchestral background, full of dramatic phrases during an intense part of the movie. It especially sounds great when you\\'re supporting surround sound.This movie was a great movie and people think it was one of the greatest letdowns in the 1990\\'s. In my opinion, it was the greatest animated movie and I would recommend that you should watch it with your family or with a friend. It is a fantastic movie...\", \\'A excellent movie, it is up there with The Secret of NIMH. The animation also is amazing, and the characters really really nice. Also the voices are the best I heard in the animations movie I seen and they really characterize the personage. I couldn\\\\\\'t not notice the sweet voice of Jenna and the looks. Very complex and very cute. Also the voice of Boris, one of a kind. The single voice that I remember being so sweet was of Ms. Brisby from the movie, The Secret of NIMH, again a movie with excellent animation and voices. I enjoyed it very much and most surely will watch it again. It just marvelous.-\"Its amazing, fantastic, uber, extraordinary, magnificent, marvelous\" -\"IT ROCKS!\" *BAM* :)\\', \"This movie evokes so much emotion in me, just thinking about it. This movie came out 1 day before my daughter was born. She still loves it to this day,and now my 6 year old son enjoys it. He has watched it three times since i got it on DVD! This movie teaches a wonderful lesson. And is just a wonderful true movie!If you can get this movie for your children. They will enjoy it for years to come, as will you!And i really don\\'t need 10 lines to explain to you how good this movie is. When you get the chance to watch it, that will be enough.\"]',\n",
              "       '[\\'In an overall solid cast, Anthony Hopkins shines in a powerful performance as Richard Nixon in this Oliver Stone film tracing the former president\\\\\\'s life from his boyhood in California to his resignation as U.S. President in 1974.Nixon is seen as a troubled figure, insecure and paranoid, with few friends. An unhappy childhood, in which he refers to himself as his mother\\\\\\'s \"faithful dog,\" in fact does dog him his whole life, as he seeks to please a demanding ultra-religious mother (Mary Steenburgen)who had already died by the time he took office as President, but whose memory and expectations lived on. Nixon is burdened with an unhappy marriage to Pat (Joan Allen) - unhappy largely because of his own obsession with political success - and haunted by the ghost of John Kennedy, who defeated him for the presidency in 1960 and who Nixon could never live up to. Kennedy was loved; Nixon was hated - he could never get over that. A scene near the end of the movie demonstrates his feelings toward JFK as he looks at Kennedy\\\\\\'s White House portrait: \"They look at you and see what they want to be; they look at me and see who they are.\"Although the movie - as any review of Nixon\\\\\\'s life will - revolves around Watergate, it provides a fascinating summary of his life, and of what added up to make him the troubled and lonely figure he really was. There\\\\\\'s also typical Oliver Stone material as dark hints of conspiracy extending far beyond Watergate are inserted. Perhaps the most unsettling being a meeting Nixon has shortly before JFK\\\\\\'s assassination with some supporters in Texas who are trying to convince him to run for the presidency again in 1964. Nixon protests that Kennedy can\\\\\\'t be beaten in \\\\\\'64. A Cuban American present says ominously \"What if Kennedy doesn\\\\\\'t run in \\\\\\'64?\"A truly fascinating portrayal of a fascinating man, even in the end somewhat sympathetic to Nixon as the film ends with his 1994 funeral service, some comments at that service by President Clinton and a summary of his career by a narrator pointing out his accomplishments. A last note: kudos to Paul Sorvino, who hit Henry Kissinger bang on.8/10\\', \\'Watergate hardly gets a mention in this film.  We see the \\\\\\'plumbers\\\\\\' donning rubber gloves, and the president fumbling with a few of his tapes, but detail is almost totally eschewed.  There is no Egil Krogh, no Jeb Magruder.  Kleindienst and Gray are mentioned only in passing.  Cox is fired by way of a spoken TV bulletin, Jaworski is not referred to at all.  We do not see anything of the titanic courtroom struggles, with all three branches of the federal government locking horns.  Though we are told that the American Constitution is self-righting, like a boat immune from capsize, we are not shown how or why.     And in this, Oliver Stone is perfectly right.  As it stands, the film is very long, and dense with detail.  There is no room for the minutiae of the cover-up, which in any event would make for a confusing narrative. Stone\\\\\\'s subject is Nixon the man, not the edifice that toppled around him.     And what a man.  Richard Milhous Nixon is a truly fascinating personality - both statesman and charlatan: ruthless and vulnerable: unable to express his emotions, yet the most emotional of politicians: a man who spent his life in the law and in high office, but who never absorbed the legal and ethical mores of public life.  Genius and crook, bold visionary and spiteful backstabber, Nixon will continue to spellbind biographers for decades to come.     \"That\\\\\\'s when it starts,\" says Stone\\\\\\'s Nixon, \"when you\\\\\\'re a kid.\"  The film takes us to Whittier, California in 1925 to see the unloved boy who struggled painfully to earn his parents\\\\\\' approval, without ever quite succeeding.  As a teenager, he levered his way into the school football squad by sheer willpower.  Lacking talent, he doggedly subjected himself to repeated physical battering in the scrimmages, \"a tackle dummy with guts\". This syndrome recurs throughout his career.  Always susceptible to scathing criticism, never quite commanding respect, Nixon never the less kept ploughing back into the melee when wiser, lesser men would have quit.  It is hardly surprising that the years of punishment should have left psychological scars.     Nixon\\\\\\'s hatred of John Kennedy had more than one source.  He was devastated by the defeat in the 1960 presidential election, but not simply because of disappointment at losing, or even because the Kennedy victory carried the odour of fraud: bitterest of all for Nixon was the realisation that the Kennedy people had played hardball more effectively than the Republicans.  Nixon had been out-sharked, and it hurt.  On a more profound level still, John Kennedy was everything that Nixon could never be.  He was a smooth, handsome prince among men, exuding poise and confidence, a patrician imbued with the habit of authority.  To Nixon, the perpetual outsider, the quaker geek who looked shoddy and disreputable, Kennedy seemed to have the dice unfairly loaded in his favour.  JFK was an East Coast bright boy and war hero, fabulously wealthy and impeccably well-connected. Nixon owned nothing and knew nobody, and was all too obviously \\\\\\'on the make\\\\\\'.  The great witch-hunts, of Hiss in the 1940\\\\\\'s and Ellsberg in the 1970\\\\\\'s, are manifestations of the chip on Nixon\\\\\\'s shoulder, the fathomless bile that he directed at East Coast college boys.     Nixon always imagined that he was hiding his pain from the world, whereas in fact it was on global display.  His nervous little laugh at moments of emotional crisis was so false, so gut-wrenchingly inappropriate, that the onlooker could catch a glimpse of the man\\\\\\'s tortured soul.  Hopkins captures the wretched laugh with devastating effectiveness, both in the scene where Nixon is confronted by a hostile man in the TV studio audience, and when he solemnly promises that none of the president\\\\\\'s men will go to jail.  In the \"Checkers\" broadcast and the presidential TV address on Watergate, Nixon tries to assure the camera that he is not a crook, and on both occasions he has the exact opposite effect, confirming to the viewer that that is precisely what he is.  Nixon seems incapable of examining his own conscience: there is a hard core which his rational mind cannot penetrate.  Maybe that is why Stone has him referring to himself in the third person throughout the film.     \\\\\\'They\\\\\\' were always out to get Nixon, without it ever being made clear just exactly who \\\\\\'they\\\\\\' might be.  The imperative for this deeply paranoid man was always to be braced, ready for the coming tackle, or to organise pre-emptive strikes against \\\\\\'them\\\\\\'.  Obstructing justice and tampering with evidence were, to Nixon, self-defensive steps that did not need to be justified.  It was obvious that such things had to be done.  The mystery at the heart of Watergate - why a president so steeped in criminal conspiracy should tape-record his own intimate conversations - makes sense when viewed from Nixon\\\\\\'s end of the telescope.  He had to have the goods on his own men, ready for the day when they turned on him.  It goes even further.  This emotional cripple could not bare his bleeding soul to anyone, so his tapes became his confessional and his confidante.  Stone\\\\\\'s film repeatedly shows Nixon in his awkward arms-extended, double V-sign pose.  It is not by chance that it looks like a crucifixion.\\', \\'Who could have possibly thought that Oliver Stone would surpass the level reached by \"JFK\", one of the greatest political thrillers ever made? Yet his \"Nixon\" is not only the harrowing political biography of the most controversial and unpopular President of the United States, but also the gripping psychological study of a tormented man who got too much to prove. It\\\\\\'s also a terrific movie served by an impressive casting: Anthony Hopkins, Joan Allen, James Woods, Bob Hoskins, Ed Harris, E.G. Marshall, Madeline Kahn and an unrecognizable Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger. And it\\\\\\'s definitely one of the best movies of 1995, which is saying a lot.\"Nixon\" borrows a lot of elements from \"JFK\" on the editing department, swinging back and forth from childhood memories to the present, from the Watergate scandal to its dark premises. The film is complex, almost confusing but never gratuitously because Nixon himself happens to be an enigmatic and larger-than-life character. Roger Ebert even compared the film to \"Citizen Kane\", establishing an interesting parallel between Richard Nixon and Charles Foster Kane. Nixon does remind of Kane in his excesses, his capability to be disdained by the establishment yet respected within his inner circle, and his heart consumed by an unconscious desire to be loved while trying to hide a torment deeply rooted in his childhood.The comparison is even truer because like Kane, Nixon hides a terrible secret, although the missing eighteen minutes from the White House recordings would unveil something more unpleasant than the mysterious \\\\\\'Rosebud\\\\\\'. Behind every great man, there\\\\\\'s a secret, but in Nixon\\\\\\'s case, there\\\\\\'s also a woman. And as Pat Nixon, Joan Allen delivers a subtle but pivotal performance as the woman who evolves in her husband\\\\\\'s shadow but in her own supportive way, acts as the only guardian angel of a man who sold his soul to a certain Machiavellian view of power. She believes in his talent to win the election, but not the hearts, people would never love him because she knows how uneasy it was for her to love him.The chronicles of a man who could never be loved, that could be indeed the subtitle of Nixon\\\\\\'s journey in the White House, in his whole political career actually. Indeed, Nixon won two elections, opened China, signed a nuclear treaty with Russia, ended the longest war America ever knew, but as great achievements as they were, Nixon\\\\\\'s dark side eclipsed them: Vietnam, Cambodia, Allende, the Watergate. In his most lucid moments, Nixon even recognizes that his road to success was paved by dead bodies, he could go to college because his older brother died of tuberculosis, Jack Kennedy was assassinated, then Bobby, his luck carried the seeds of his doom. This is when the comparison with \"JFK\" stops, it\\\\\\'s not an investigation but a character study. And as Dick Nixon, Anthony Hopkins never tries to make an impersonation but rather creates his own personification of an eternal outcast, haunted by the ghosts from the past, a man who always had to forge his carapace, by building his own legend through his modest Quaker background \"in the poorest farm of California\", always using it as an alibi to justify that he\\\\\\'s one of the \\\\\\'little people\\\\\\'. And when an outcast experiments the power, and tastes its irreplaceable savor after the post-War republican wave, he can\\\\\\'t renounce it. Nixon knew he was born to rule the most powerful country of the world, like a personal revenge: \"Only if you have been in the deepest valley, can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain.\" This taste for revenge is his inner demon.I\\\\\\'m not comparing two characters, but \"Nixon\" kind of reminded me of \"Downfall\" in the way the White House is showed, as a sort of bunker where the state\\\\\\'s ugliest secrets are covered, a shadowy and gloomy place waiting for the enemy (here the media) to come to the leader. And one by one, like a sinking ship, every faithful soldier is drown in the scandal, and Nixon, as the Captain, is the last to leave. Ebert wrote about Bruno Ganz\\\\\\' performance as Hitler: \"Admiration I did not feel. Sympathy I felt in the sense that I would feel it for a rabid dog, while accepting that it must be destroyed.\" In a lesser measure of course, I think this could work as the right answer to those who believed that Stone, a notorious left wing, created empathy toward Nixon. Stone never used his patriotism at the expenses of intelligence. Nixon is responsible of his downfall but a whole system is to blame, Nixon was flawed but his enemies weren\\\\\\'t nobler. And that\\\\\\'s what Stone brilliantly denounces. In many scenes, Nixon reminds the Press of its lack of objectivity, its obsession and outspoken hatred. These words are still relevant today; Nixon is the quintessential incarnation of the \\\\\\'person we love to hate\\\\\\'. Indeed, with his victory sign trademark, his sweating and angry look contrasting with Kennedy\\\\\\'s shining smile, from his \"I\\\\\\'m not a crook\" to his dog Checkers, from his resignation to \"The Simpsons\" (he even inspired through his middle-name the name of Milhouse) to hold-up masks, he\\\\\\'s in his way, an icon of popular culture, or unpopular if you prefer. Nixon appears as an individual whose republican obedience veiled his true idealism, his fascination for Lincoln, the President who ended the Civil War, or Kennedy as a beloved figure. People look at Kennedy and want to be him, but when they look at them, they find Nixon, less than a low self-esteem; it\\\\\\'s a sentiment of total waste that invades his heart when he look at Kennedy\\\\\\'s picture during his last night in the White House. Nixon\\\\\\'s tragedy is America\\\\\\'s, and maybe that\\\\\\'s why he was loathed, because people don\\\\\\'t want to look at themselves.\\', \\'I\\\\\\'m not normally a fan of Oliver Stone (in fact, I\\\\\\'ve NEVER liked an Oliver Stone picture before)but this one just blew me away. The reason I usually don\\\\\\'t like him is that, though he is a great technical director and visual stylist, his scripts are heavy-handed and one-sided to the point of absurdity. But not here. In fact, the script is perhaps the most impressive element in this whole movie, not only for how ambiguous and even-handed it is in dealing with Nixon as a character, but also for the brilliant way it moves around in time. It starts with Nixon, feeling embattled in the White House in 1973 as the Watergate hearings are upon him, and uses the device of him listening to his secret tapes to jump back and forth to previous eras, flawlessly moving between past and present to give an impressionistic, kaleidoscopic overview of the man\\\\\\'s life, instead of following the staid and ho-hum linear approach most movie biographies take (most recent example: \"Man on the Moon\", the bio on Andy Kaufman which was a snoozer in spite of a great performance by Jim Carrey mainly because of the dry boring, \"This happened. . .And then this happened\" approach).Another reason to see this film is the brilliant, absolutely overwhelming lead performance by Anthony Hopkins; his Nixon may not look or sound exactly like the 37th president (but come on, except maybe for Ed Sullivan, who does?) but he embodies his qualities - strengths as well as weaknesses - to such an enormous degree that he simply BECOMES Nixon, at least for the three hours the movie is on screen.I have to say, though, I was not nearly as impressed as every one else (critics and general audiences alike) seems to be about Joan Allen as Pat Nixon. It\\\\\\'s nothing against her performance, she did fine, it\\\\\\'s just that as written, the part is rather weak. In fact, I was much more bothered about the liberties the filmmakers took in fleshing out her character than in all the political events; it\\\\\\'s like, whenever they wanted to have someone blast Nixon or act as his conscience, they\\\\\\'d trot out Ol\\\\\\' Pat, giving her some of the most embarrasingly \"speechified\" moments in all of the movies - almost none of their scenes together ringed true as husband as wife; it was more like Nixon sitting across from the Filmmakers\\\\\\' Conscience. In fact, she\\\\\\'s angry at him so often in the film you have to wonder, what exactly does she love about the man? The film never answers (or attempts to answer) this question.But this one minor quibble is not enough to make me downgrade this film. It is an absolutely stunning achievement by any stretch of the imagination, and it contains some interesting thematic and technical echoes of both Citizen Kane (cavernous high ceiling scenes, a \"March of Time\"-type newsreel on Nixon, a dinner scene between Dick and Pat at a long, impersonal table) as well as The Godfather (the burnished, half-dark half-light cinematography, several \"chamber of power\" scenes in tight, dark and claustrophobic rooms)that I found, in context, to be totally appropriate. It paints both Nixon and the times he (and the country) lived through on a grand and mythic scale that was truly awesome and, once again, entirely appropriate. Yes, it\\\\\\'s a film that is at times big, loud and bombastic (because so, after all, was Nixon himself) but, just as often quiet, contemplative and told at an achingly *human* level. The contrast between these two states is what gives the film a good deal of its overall power and, as I\\\\\\'ve said, I never would have believed that Stone would have been capable of doing the smaller, quieter scenes so well.This is a good film to have on tape or DVD, for two reasons. It\\\\\\'s so long, and so dense with facts, characters and events, that you\\\\\\'re not likely to want to watch it all the way straight through (the first time I saw it was in the theater and though I was held spellbound, I began wishing for an intermission at about the two-hour mark, not so much to stretch my legs but to give my brain a chance to process all I\\\\\\'d seen and heard so far). Also, and more importantly, the videotape includes after the credits two scenes cut out of the final film for time purposes. In both cases, I believe, a severe mistake was made - these are both, I believe, ESSENTIAL sequences; not just nice to have as an additional bargain, but scenes which Stone should have fought tooth and nail to keep in (even cutting out some others if he had to - my vote would have been to excise a few of those Pat Nixon scenes instead). Once scene involves Nixon\\\\\\'s visit to the CIA and another a discussion between Nixon and J. Edgar Hoover in the Oval Office. The first scene is a masterpiece of writing and acting (with Sam Waterston as CIA Director Richard Helms, otherwise in no other scene of the movie) and the other is, I think, key in understanding Nixon\\\\\\'s motivation to begin taping his White House conversations in the first place (also - an issue which is touched on no other place in the movie). I feel that these two scenes should be edited back into their appropriate places in the movie; seeing them separated from the rest of the film is better than not seeing them at all, but they really belong as part of the entire story.\\', \\'Richard Nixon\\\\\\'s (Oscar-nominee Anthony Hopkins) life is told from his early childhood days in 1920s California to his disgraceful resignation in 1974 from the Watergate scandal (one of the stupidest and most trivial events of U.S. history). The 37th president of the U.S. lost the 1960 presidential election to JFK and then lost the California governor race of 1962. By 1963 it appears that Nixon is out of the spotlight for good politically and that he is struggling to keep his marriage to Pat Nixon (a superb turn by Oscar-nominee Joan Allen in arguably her finest role) alive. Things turn strange though as Nixon has strange meetings with big-time oil men in Texas (Larry Hagman leading the group) and even with J. Edgar Hoover (scene-stealer Bob Hoskins). It is obvious that there are some potentially sinister things going on from high-ranking people. Soon JFK is assassinated, the 1964 election becomes a mess for both parties as LBJ wins by default and then LBJ decides not to run in 1968. The Republicans once again turn to Nixon, but Nixon (full of self-doubt and inferiority complexes) is fearful that 1968 against RFK will be a repeat of 1960 (Nixon believes that JFK and the Democrats stole the 1960 presidency). More cloak and dagger situations occur and RFK is assassinated in California, leaving the door open for Nixon to win the presidency. Vietnam, a whole host of questionable allies (led by James Woods, E.G. Marshall, J.T. Walsh, David Paymer, David Hyde Pierce, Powers Boothe, Fyvush Finkel) and constant advisement from Henry Kissinger (an amazing transformation by Paul Sorvino, who rivals Hopkins\\\\\\' performance the whole way) end up turning Nixon\\\\\\'s life upside down. Soon taped White House conversations and growing paranoia also pops up and public/national/international/military/social chaos ensues. While all this occurs the president\\\\\\'s personal life is shown through flashbacks (Mary Steenburgen as his mother and Tony Goldwyn as his older brother dominate these parts of the film). We see two of his brothers dying of tuberculosis, his short courtship of his wife and various other parts of his early life that stand out. The Watergate break-in (led by Ed Harris) continues to be one of the strangest things that has ever happened (the motives of the apparent burglary have never been clear). 18 minutes of missing audio recordings are one of the biggest mysteries of the 20th Century. Director Oliver Stone (who received an Oscar nod for co-writing the script) surprisingly is unbiased with this film. Watching \"Platoon\", \"Born on the Fourth of July\" and \"JFK\" would lead one to believe that Stone would pull no punches with \"Nixon\". However he gives Nixon\\\\\\'s story an element of truth and compassion. There are so many unknown things that went on with Nixon throughout his political career that Stone has to fill in lots of missing pieces with speculations (some that seem very logical and some not so much). Thus the film goes on and on (running about 195 minutes). Even with all the airtime though the film does not move slowly and never becomes dull. In fact it is one of those projects that could have gone on even longer and it still would have been an interest-generator. Whether you like, dislike or are indifferent when it comes to Nixon the person, \"Nixon\" the movie is an outstanding achievement that stands high with Stone\\\\\\'s better works and also deceptively becomes one of the more under-rated and under-appreciated pictures of the 1990s. 5 stars out of 5.\\', \"Oliver Stone has a way of making films that grab you and hold you until the final frame.  His films are usually controversial and that\\'s what generates much debate and Nixon is no exception.  Anthony Hopkins assumes the mantle of Richard M. Nixon and he does it with style. His Nixon is a complex man, full of ambition and dreams, but also filled with demons.  Nixon lives in the shadow of JFK, and because of that, he feels he can never live up to the greatness that he aspires to.  Joan Allen is equally convincing as Pat Nixon.  She is a strong woman who loves her husband, but unlike Nixon, she grows tired of the political world. The film works best when we see the inner workings of the Nixon Whitehouse.  We see the coverup of the Watergate break in.  We see Nixon\\'s historic visit to China and we see the final farewell of a flawed, but ambitious man.  It\\'s hard to cram an entire lifetime into a three hour film, but Stone manages to do it well.  We get brief glimpses into Nixon\\'s past and we see the events that eventually undid him.  Some may say that Nixon is painted in an unfair light.  I think Stone actually sympathizes with him.  Here was a man who came into power in the middle of a war.  He was feared by many and misunderstood by all.   Nixon was able to rise above it all for a short period of time, and in that brief period, he did have the world.\", \"I will start by saying I am an Oliver Stone fan. For some particular reason though I did not expect to like this movie but obviously I did. He actually unexpectedly gave a very fair depiction of Nixon. Nixon really transformed before my eyes in here. That was really something special to see.The acting was quite good. Anthony Hopkins though totally uplifted this movie. I could imagine many people saying his performance was over-the-top or a bit too surreal at times. Yet that is what really made his performance so amazing. The way he was able to transform the many crazy and totally off the wall aspects of Nixon and make them into a reality. To me as the movie went on I felt I was in some way able to see his paranoia, anxiety, thirst for power and just the simple fact of wanting to be liked. I could see he was more of a troubled and vulnerable man than a monster. He never quite connected with anybody which made him bitter and fueled his paranoia and greed even more. To me Hopkins portrayed this all perfectly, all the complexities and inner feelings of Nixon. Hopkins slipped into this role in way that you rarely see. He became Nixon, and at times I was speechless or should I say thoughtless watching him portray such an important figure in such a way. More and more I felt sorry for Nixon, as he looked more and more like a schizophrenic. To me this role was more psychologically bone-chilling than his role as Hannibal Lechter in Silence of the Lambs and I have no problem debating that. The rest of the cast was quite good as well. Joan Allen was very good in showing the complex relationship/marriage she had with Richard Nixon. James Woods freaked me out at times displaying that pure evil and hatred at times that Hopkins showed as Nixon. Paul Sorvino was very good as Henry Kissinger. Mary Steenburgen was interesting to watch in the very limited time she played in here. The two actors though other than Hopkins though that really stood out to me were Bob Hoskins and Sam Waterston. Despite Hoskins not giving an amazing performance and having very limited time he gave me chills just seeing J. Edgar Hoover being portrayed in some sort of way. Sam Waterston despite being limited to really just one scene was even more chilling than the rest of the cast(excluding Hopkins) combined in that one moment. That moment was one of the most intense face to face scenes that I have ever seen. It was so memorable.The directing was very good. It was not the best I have seen from Oliver Stone but it was up there. For the first 45 minutes or so I was a bit confused about what was happening and the flow of the movie but I got used to it. The first portion of the movie did feel unbalanced at times but the feel of the movie got better as it wore on. Going back to that one scene between Sam Waterston and Anthony Hopkins, I felt this scene was one of the best directed and written scenes I have seen from Oliver Stone or anyone ever. That scene was a microcosm of the movie. The motion-sickness, mind scrambling, paranoid feeling of that scene captured the entire movie. The feeling of even seeing the president himself being treated like a puppet, despite not that shocking, was mind numbing to watch. That scene was true testament to the writing and directing abilities of Oliver Stone.The writing was also very good throughout. It seemed as if everything Stone wanted to get across got across. The writing was not amazing but it certainly served it duty. The cinematography was great though. Stone always knows how to get his point across in the way he photographs a movie even if all of other aspects of the movie fail. That dark Oliver Stonish feeling kept on creeping in on every scene, but also that dark psychological feeling that he had put in Born On the Fourth of July and Platoon also was felt through the cinematography. The music by John Williams, who always knows how to capture a moment musically, was simply perfect in here again.I can understand this movie being boring to a lot of people or it being considered propaganda. Yet I think this movie is an overlooked masterpiece. Just seeing Anthony Hopkins perform as Nixon is a good enough reason to see this movie. He took control of this movie by force and took it to another level. Despite this being an Oliver Stone movie it is more fair than you would think. Of course this movie may have a few conspiracy theories included in it but Oliver Stone never forces his theories on people. There is a reason why at the beginning at every movie he puts a disclaimer saying that not everything in his movies are facts. Despite it being great I don\\'t know if this is a movie for everyone. This movie seems to be crazy and surreal but isn\\'t that how life seems to be at times as well?\", \\'Hopkins is remarkable as Nixon.  Wisely not even trying for an exact likeness, his interpretation of that so-familiar physicality is uncannily evocative.  From the very start, the characterisation is spot-on - the jut of the lower jaw, the growly voice, the rounded shoulders.  Once the viewer has adjusted to the initial shock, Hopkins IS Nixon.  It ceases to be an issue.Theodore Roosevelt, Washington, Kennedy and (most of all) Lincoln look down from the White House walls at Nixon, their solemn portraits hovering like admonishing ghosts over the Watergate squalor.  In life, Roosevelt was bold and self-assured, whereas Nixon dithers: Washington\\\\\\'s self-effacing propriety confronts a Nixon who is suggesting that the Nazis were right. Kennedy is everything that Nixon could never be - above all else, at ease with himself.  Lincoln looks down, from the office wall and from his marble seat in the Memorial, in silent rebuke as his successor debases the presidency.Some of the camera tricks don\\\\\\'t work.  We see Nixon rooted to the spot at Love Field as the camera soars up and away from him.  Why?  Obtrusive camera movement is justified only if it adds to our understanding of character or plot.  This shot seems to have been included merely for its cleverness.  The same is true of the little flashes of black-and-white which keep interrupting the action.  At one point, in a dialogue between Nixon and Haldeman, the focus is un-subtly and repeatedly thrown from one man to the other.  What does this achieve?  Is some artistic goal being pursued, or are the effects included for their own sake?  What is the symbolic importance (if any) of the vanishing racehorses?Much of the attention to detail is of a very high order.  Stone\\\\\\'s writing team has done its homework, and we get authentic touches such as Nixon\\\\\\'s love of log fires, which meant having to run the White House air conditioning system at full blast during summer.  The reconstructions of the White House interiors are superb.  We see Nixon and Pat engaging in a domestic scrap beneath murals of more edifying battles like Yorktown and Saratoga.  Historical events, recorded on news film at the time, are brilliantly reconstituted, replacing the real Nixon with the Hopkins version.  Thus we get convincing reconstructions of the Kennedy TV debate and the 1962 \\\\\\'retirement\\\\\\' speech.  Young Nixon\\\\\\'s courtship of Pat is narrated without dialogue as a grainy, jumpy home movie - and is beautifully done.  I did not feel quite so positive about the Alger Hiss segment. Welles did this \\\\\\'newsreel flashback\\\\\\' idea in \"Citizen Kane\" more than half a century earlier, and did it with such flair that anything which follows is sure to look jaded.  It also seemed to me that this passage is badly-placed, coming immediately after the 1962 California defeat.James Wood plays Bob Haldeman, and does his usual admirable, photogenic best.  My quibble with the characterisation is, this isn\\\\\\'t THE Haldeman. The historical personage was grimmer, more stately, more formidable (Fred Emery\\\\\\'s \"Watergate\" bears this out).  Wood is restricted here to the role of an aide, rather than the Chief of the White House Staff, an emperor within his own (not inconsiderable) domain.Pat Nixon does not ring true either, but for different reasons.  Joan Allen is more than competent as the steely, astute power behind the Nixon throne.  The fault is in the characterisation rather than the actor.  The real Pat was (so far as one can judge) an altogether less articulate, less philosophical, less knowing individual.  Watch her in the REAL \"Checkers\" broadcast - she is a stiff, repressed, passive woman, a true 1950\\\\\\'s Republican wife, not the power broker that this film would have us believe. It is hard to accept, for example, that Nixon\\\\\\'s decision to retire in 1962 was his wife\\\\\\'s diktat.There are elements of this otherwise excellent film which simply don\\\\\\'t work.  Would the President of the United States REALLY be pulled out of a face-to-face meeting with Brezhnev to deal with some Watergate minutiae? The real-life Mitchell said that he tolerated Martha\\\\\\'s indiscretions \"because I love her\".  This touching declaration is cheapened in the film, for no good reason.  Similarly, Tricia Nixon\\\\\\'s exchange with her father was, in real life, an assertion of unconditional loyalty which was both moving and very much to Nixon\\\\\\'s credit.  The film version has her asking sceptically, \"Did you cover up?\"  This is quite wrong.  The Nixon women would have considered it treachery even to frame such a question.John Williams\\\\\\' epic score is in keeping with the classical tragedy acted out before us.  Nixon\\\\\\'s tearful prayer with Kissinger and the farewell speech to the White House staff are scenes of extraordinary power.Paul Sorvino gives us a marvellous Kissinger, though in my humble opinion Stone goes too far when he makes Kissinger the White House \\\\\\'leaker\\\\\\' and accuses the Secretary of State of complicity in the Watergate break-ins.One scene which works splendidly is the (true) incident at the Lincoln Memorial.  Nixon tries to glad-hand the indignant youngsters, using the hearty, patronising approach of a bygone generation.  The sad revulsion of the protesters shows the gulf between Nixon\\\\\\'s consciousness and the spirit of the age.\"I hope I haven\\\\\\'t let you down\" is uttered one single time by Nixon, towards the end of the film.  The truth is, he hit on this formula of words and used it again and again during the final days of his presidency.  It was a last desperate attempt to tweak our sympathy-nodes.  As such, it was utterly gauche, utterly craven, utterly guileful, yet utterly unrealistic. In fact, utterly Nixon.\\', \\'Richard Nixon is one of the most controversial heads of state of the twentieth century. During his tenure as president of the United States, he earned a general hatred almost as high as the power and influence of his office. He was investigated, vilified, attacked but never condemned. Even though I\\\\\\'m not an American nor an expert of these period, I feel it is necessary to make an unbiased and objective historical analysis of this president, I just don\\\\\\'t know if that has already happened. Even so, the film we have here didn\\\\\\'t seem partial, trying to remain neutral to some extent.Directed by Oliver Stone, it\\\\\\'s not appropriate for people who don\\\\\\'t know anything about Nixon, or Watergate, or this period of American history, since the film wasn\\\\\\'t wasting time explaining anything. So if you didn\\\\\\'t understand why Nixon opened the US to China or what was the Watergate or the Bay of Pigs, I suggest you ignore the movie for now and first go read some books or see some documentaries about it. Another problem I want to highlight is the huge web of conspiracies and obscure theories that the film weaves around the president. It never lets us understand what \"crimes of responsibility\" Nixon has committed. The film also suggests, without subtleties, that Nixon was a simple man who rose in life but wasn\\\\\\'t accepted by the \"American aristocracy\" because of this humble origin, which left him deeply hurt. I don\\\\\\'t know if it\\\\\\'s true, but the film indicates that as origin of President\\\\\\'s lack of scruples.Anthony Hopkins assures the main role in an interesting performance, but that\\\\\\'s far from being his best. He made a good preparation and tried his best to be Nixon, but has few physical similarities with him, not to mention his extreme difficulty in imitating president\\\\\\'s characteristic voice. Anyway, Hopkins was brilliant at his character\\\\\\'s psychological work, with most dramatic scenes going on as he, semi-drunk, reviews his decisions while listening to his famous audio tapes. The remaining cast does a reasonable supporting work. I will not close my review without left a word of appreciation to the sets and costumes, which rebuilt the atmosphere and culture of the Seventies quite well, much like the rooms and offices within White House. Not being exceptional, it\\\\\\'s an elegant, quality film, that helps us think about an important period in American history.\\']',\n",
              "       '[\\'\"Cutthroat Island\" is a 1995 film with chaotic production and distribution and with unfair reviews of the professional critics. Renny Harlin and Geena Davis were married at that time and he convinced the producers to cast his wife in an action film in a complete misevaluation of her talent. Geena Davis was a great actress in comedy and drama genres in the 80´s and 90´s but was only reasonable in the role of the female pirate Morgan Adams. Another problem was to find an actor for Morgan´s slave William Shaw since Matthew Modine was the last choice in a long list of actors that refused the role. It seems that this notorious film was also the responsible for the bankruptcy of Carolco Pictures since the box office was frustrating.Said that, \"Cutthroat Island\" is indeed an entertaining modern (in 1995) pirate movie, with a good story. The successful franchize \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" is an improvement of \"Cutthroat Island\" with better technology, budget and cast. But the stories are equaly entertaining and funny. In the end, forget the bad ratings of professional critics and have a goodtime watching this film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"A Ilha da Garganta Cortada\" (\"The Cutthroat Island\")\\', \"The film opens in Jamaican coast in 1668While the Port Royal governor wants so badly the lady pirate, Morgan Adams, and will pay well for her, Dawg Brown (Frank Langella) was grabbing Morgan\\'s father Black Harry (Harris Yulin) to take the first piece of a map (split into three separate pieces) to Cutthroat Island, where a treasure of a Spanish gold ship is said to be buried thereEach of the other sections of the map is held by Morgan\\'s two uncles: Dawg-the bad pirate who doesn\\'t want to share the treasure-has the second piece stolen from a now-deceased brother, and Mordachai holds the third at Spittlefied HarborSo to seek the Spanish Treasure and to avenge her father\\'s death, Morgan (Geena Davis) has to join with her uncle Mordachai and fight her murderous uncle to obtain the third part of the mapThe governor of the island (Patrick Malahide) offers Morgan two alternatives: One, an ignominious death on the gallows or she might cut him in for a share of her grandfather\\'s treasureAt the slave market, Morgan was looking for a man who can read Latin So she picked a handsome convict who passes himself off as a physician with a natural pitch for music and a perfect taste in wine His name was William Shaw (Matthew Modine).If you enjoy Seventeenth Century pirate movies, and like to see how 92 million dollars were spent in sea-battles, rope-swinging, slow motion swashbuckling action, cannons with many explosions and many fires, plenty of rum, cove and cliffs, lots of treasure, the destruction of two Jamaican towns, gorgeous ocean vistas and breathtaking visuals don\\'t miss this one!\", \"Cutthroat Island is a movie that you can just sit back, relax and watch it with a big goofy grin on your face.  Sure it tanked at the box office, but don\\'t disregard it totally.  It\\'s entertaining as hell.  Geena Davis is rather engaging as a female pirate and Frank Langella seemed to be enjoying himself.  Most people will say that this movie can\\'t hold a candle to the pirate films of Errol Flynn, and they\\'re right.  But for a rock em sock em pirate adventure with more explosions than the high seas ever saw, watch Cutthroat Island.\", \\'Making a valiant stab at becoming an action figure, Geena Davis plays Morgan Adams, a wily, rough & tumble pirate woman who lives for adventure and the like. When her evil Uncle Dawg (Frank Langella) turns on her and her dad, it\\\\\\'s a race against time for Morgan as she tries to piece together a map that will lead her to Cut-Throat Island, where unimaginable wealth in stolen pirate gold resides. Along the way she is pursued by an evil British officer who goes into cahoots with treacherous crew members and Dawg, aided by a pretty boy Jack-of-all-trades thief named William Shaw (Matthew Modine), and confronted with a series of wildly over the top set pieces that no human being could possibly survive. One of the most expensive flops ever made, this overlong but endearing and even occasionally exciting film deserved much better than what it got in the summer of the mid-90s. Not quite as funny as \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" but still fun. Already a cardboard cut-out role to begin with, Geena Davis struggles to overcome her natural aura of motherly warmth to play the roughish Morgan, but she plays the part well enough (she really does come across as somebody\\\\\\'s mother, albeit the kind of mother neighborhood boys fantasize about). It\\\\\\'s easy to imagine her in the ring with Keira Knightley - who played Elizabeth Swann in \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" - and to have Geena walloping Keira\\\\\\'s waif like frame. Matthew Modine has his moments as Shaw and Frank \"Dracula/Skeletor\" Langella is enjoyably hammy as Dawg.If nothing else, rent it for the expensive sets, fancy costumes, and elaborate, over the top stunts - many of which Davis and Modine did themselves.\\', \"This film was responsible for the bankruptcy of the company behind it, Carolco. Which is a shame, but the film is not as bad as it is rumoured to be. Far from it. It\\'s above average oldfashioned entertainment.The soundtrack alone is a standout. Sweeping and powerful, it serves the plotline well and it\\'s a joy to listen to on its own. Although the characters aren\\'t among the most complex and well defined in movie history, they work (with a couple of exceptions, among them Maury Chaykin as John Reed, whose acting just doesn\\'t match the tone of the film). And then there\\'s the beautifully reconstructed pirate ships, well choreographed action sequences and terrific special effects.\\\\nIn short this is a film that has an unfair rep and it is really worth your time. A great warmup for Pirates of the Caribbean (which hasn\\'t opened yet in this neck of the woods).\", \\'One film I added to my \"Best Films of 1995\" list!!I still don\\\\\\'t know why this film was never a hit.  I mean it was no Best Picture contender, but it was a great action film and it was Renny Harlin at the top of his game!Geenea Davis never looked better and director Renny Harlin has never made a more action packed film since Cutthroat Island or after Cutthroat Island!I saw the film 2xs when it first hit theaters, then bought my copy as soon as it it video (this was before DVD came into play then I up-graded my copy) and I loved it then and I still love it!It\\\\\\'s just a great ol\\\\\\' adventure story about a female pirate (Geena Davis looking really good) and her companion race against their rivals to find a hidden island that contains a fabulous treasure.  Whats up against her besides her nasty uncle is a crew that is sceptical of her leadership abilities, so she must complete her quest before they mutiny against her.I think the reason so many critics hated it was because it was a woman doing what men only thought they could do and a woman doing it better!The plot had strong action, great lines and a strong plot with a fiery woman\\\\\\'s point of view, with lots of action and romance with that ol\\\\\\' B movie adventure fell that still to this day keeps me on the edge of my seat no matter how many times I watch it!Bravo Renny Harlin and Geena Davis!!Who knows with a stroke of luck and a few movie buffs like me who love this little undiscovered lost treasure of a film it may just one day see the light of day as a un-song hero of pirate films and become a cult classic!One can only hope!\\', \\'Despite being fun to watch and very entertaining, this is not a film that draws me back for many viewings. Maybe it\\\\\\'s too absurd: a beautiful woman pirate \"Morgan Adams\" (Geena Davis) punching everyone out at every turn can get a ridiculous and tiresome after awhile. It just an excess of everything, almost cartoon-like.If you haven\\\\\\'t had enough action in first hour (and you do), the last half really goes crazy with a non-stop battle scene that goes on and on and on.Nevertheless, there are some good things to watch in here besides Davis and her pretty face. the movie was filmed in Malta and in Thailand and features some beautiful island photography. The ship is magnificent and when two ships are side-by-side firing cannons at one another, it\\\\\\'s an awesome sight and even more awesome sound. You really need to watch this with a good stereo system to appreciate the great audio work in here.Frank Langella also makes for an interestingly effective villain (\"Dawg Brown\") while Matthew Modine (\"William Shaw\") chips in with a co-star and male companion for the good guy, er good girl , Davis character.\\', \"Just take this as it is: a fun aventure film to enjoy with a big bowl of popcorn. Geena Davis\\' natural face and statuesque figure, Thailand\\'s breathtaking beaches/islands, ridiculously entertaining fight and chase scenes, gorgeous pirate ships, a hilarious pet monkey, and memorable characters, they\\'re all a delight to watch. The soundtrack is perfectly suited for it.\\\\nI give this film a 6.5.\", \\'Who says women can\\\\\\'t be good pirates? Being a woman certainly doesn\\\\\\'t stop Morgan Adams (Geena Davis) from plundering and \"manning\" the high seas. Sure, she\\\\\\'s a bit incredible at first, but this movie is more about the classic treasure-hunt adventures of Robert Louis Stevenson than any life realities. Just look at the success of Pirates of the Caribbean! At least this movie is far more realistic than that, without any curses and such and...sadly, without the prizewinning role played by Depp. Davis does manage to lend credence to the part of a strong woman who still maintains some rules and beliefs in her pirating. She is the daughter of a pirate captain. Her father is murdered by her uncle, Dawg (Frank Langella), in his search for a mysterious treasure. Apparently, several of the family members each carried a piece of the map to this treasure but none of them wanted to share it and thus, it has remained unfound. Morgan begins a journey to get that which is rightfully her\\\\\\'s and her shipmates, all while being pursued by the British navy, her uncle, and amorously pursued by a professional thief, William Shaw (Matthew Modine). Cutthroat Island is a new tale of a pirate classic! 8/10\\']',\n",
              "       '[\\'This is one of the best films of the 90\\\\\\'s hands down. Without a doubt this has become one of my favorite movies. I\\\\\\'m not sure why really, I just love it. I think because I read the book and a lot of what happened in real life happened in my little town in Chicago. No names, and my old boss who runs our town grocery store actually knew \"Ace\". Again, no names. That was always pretty cool to me, since my town really didn\\\\\\'t have much excitement. I guess also because I\\\\\\'m a huge fan of Martin, Robert, and Joe\\\\\\'s. When they work together, they create masterpieces. I\\\\\\'ve read a lot of comments on IMDb, and more than 50% of the comments are calling this \"Goodfells Part 2\". Is it \"Goodfellas Part 2\", in my opinion, no. Yes, it\\\\\\'s very similar situations, but it\\\\\\'s not the same plot. It\\\\\\'s a little more gory and more bright. \"Casino\" is mainly about the rise and fall of Las Vegas. When Robert DeNiro\\\\\\'s character says \"It\\\\\\'s more like Disney Land now\". Actually that\\\\\\'s true, it\\\\\\'s not like it used to be. I\\\\\\'m only 20, but my mom and dad told me how different the times were in the 60\\\\\\'s and 70\\\\\\'s. Everyone was more close and wanted to know who you were and how everything was going. Everything is more corporate greed now-a-days. But back onto the movie, it does have gangsta\\\\\\'s in it, and with that comes some pretty gruesome violence.Robert DeNiro. No words can describe how wonderful of an actor he is. If you read in most of my comments, you can tell I\\\\\\'m a fan. This movie is actually what made me into a huge fan of his. He\\\\\\'s dialog and image is very powerful and you understand his position. You want to love him, even though technically he\\\\\\'s a bad guy too, you still think he is so cool. A lot of people I talked too: the guys wanted to be him and the girls wanted to be with him. What a performance, it deserved more praise.Joe does it again being the A$$hole who thinks with his gun and not with his head. Joe as an actor is very remarkable. He\\\\\\'s only 5\\\\\\' 6\\\\\\'\\\\\\', but he is so intimidating. His speech in the desert with Ace and the big confrontation. \"You want me to get out of my own town?! Don\\\\\\'t *bleep* with me, Ace!\" Does he swear in this movie? Oh, yeah. A lot, we\\\\\\'re talking 400+ f-words, guys. But you get past the vulgar language and just enjoy what Joe says and does. The head vice scene and the metal bat scene with Joe is two of the most disturbing scenes in cinematic history.Sharon Stone, what can I say? What a remarkable performance! She was very much robbed of her deserved Oscar. I was reading in my \"Rober DeNiro: A history of his films\" that Sharon over shined both Joe\\\\\\'s and Robert\\\\\\'s performance. In some ways that is very true. She plays a gold-digging, druggie, drunk, hustling, whore. She is very glamorous in the film though, she is covered in beautiful gowns and jewelery that no guy could ever resist. Her first scene where Robert first sees her and she is stealing chips from a guy who has \"hired\" her for a night was extremely effective. You can see why Ace fell so hard for her. What a terrific performance in the end. When she screams at Ace \"I will go to the FBI! I will go to the police! I\\\\\\'m not protecting you anymore!\", you get scarred and can\\\\\\'t help but watch more even though you are sitting on your butt for more than 2 1/2 hours. You hate her character so much, you want her to get what\\\\\\'s coming to her, that\\\\\\'s what makes a terrific performance. When you actually want to make sure that this character gets the justice he or she deserves. Sharon, I apologize, you deserved more praise as well.Martin Scorcesse. One of the greatest living directors of our time. This film was very wonderfully made with great visuals. The soundtrack really adds a lot, I\\\\\\'m telling you, and the theatrical trailer with the song \"Gimme Shelter\" by the Rolling Stones, what a great feel. Martin has been nominated several times for an Oscar, but they snub him. I think because his films are so violent and typical. But they remain classics. I\\\\\\'m disappointed with the Oscars, this man deserves more. Whew. \"Casino\" is an excellent movie that I highly recommend for mob movie lovers. Don\\\\\\'t compare this to \"Goodfellas\", let it stand on it\\\\\\'s own. But please, this is not a movie for children in any manor. For the parents, this is a movie that should be on the wait until the later teens. It\\\\\\'s very violent, we\\\\\\'re talking a head in a vice, a beating with a metal bat(just to name a few violent scenes, there\\\\\\'s more)drugs, sex, and very vulgar language. This is for adults only!It\\\\\\'s a great movie that deserves very much to be on the top 250. I\\\\\\'d like to see it in the top 100, but we\\\\\\'ll see. 10/10\\', \\'I generally avoid violent films...which is why I resisted watching \"Casino\" for a long time. However, despite being very violent in spots, the film turned out to be very compelling....it was far more than just violence and had an interesting look at the mob influence in Las Vegas back in the day.The film is unusual in that it has two leading men with parallel stories. Sometimes Ace and Nicky (Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci) were in scenes together....often they were apart...each doing his own thing. As for Ace, he was a smart man who was in charge of one of Vegas\\\\\\' top casinos. He was tough...but basically honest for a mobster. As for Nicky, as you\\\\\\'d expect with a Joe Pesci character, he\\\\\\'s a bit of a nut-job....often out of control and letting anger govern most of his decisions. Unlike Ace who had a veneer of honesty about him, Nicky was a hood...and didn\\\\\\'t mind this. Eventually, the pair end up having a downfall. How and what happens to each you\\\\\\'ll have to see for yourself.The parts of this film I enjoyed the most were when you learned about how Vegas operated. Seeing Ace dealing with crooked gamblers was especially interesting. And, in this sense, I enjoyed the film much more than \"Goodfellas\"...also with the same stars and same director. This is because \"Goodfellas\" was mostly just about violence and crime...whereas \"Casino\" seemed to have more story and wasn\\\\\\'t always about excessive violence and nastiness...not that the film is in any way a \\\\\\'nice\\\\\\' picture. It\\\\\\'s filled with obscenities, nasty folks and a few scenes of horrific violence. Think about this before you decide whether or not to see the movie.By the way, this is only a personal choice and doesn\\\\\\'t really affect the movie much, but one thing I did not love about the film is the omnipresent pop music....which at times made the film seem like a music video. I think less of this would have been nice.\\', \\'I saw Goodfellas first and more times than Casino. Yet, I totally love Casino as it is one of the best movies I have literally ever seen. I find Goodfellas to be overrated and Casino to be the movie that learned from the former\\\\\\'s flaws.Something I really do think (more than my own opinion) is that if this was released before Goodfellas, this would be more liked. No new ground was broken, everything was just elevated.Robert De Niro gives his most underrated performance--as well as the second best of the year (behind Nicolas Cage in Leaving Las Vegas)-- as Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein. Ace is an unbeatable gambler who secures the mob\\\\\\'s casino shenanigans while his lifelong best friend, Nicky Santoro (Pesci) keeps everybody in line. The only real difference between Nicky and Tommy from Goodfellas is Tommy has curlier hair. There\\\\\\'s divided opinion on who is crazier/more violent. I lean towards Nicky. Ace helps the casino grow and eventually seizes full power by becoming the owner. Nicky\\\\\\'s wild and crazy antics get him banned from every Las Vegas casino, so he decides to create his own. Meanwhile, Ace blindly falls for a beautiful prostitute named Ginger (Stone) and they get married. Her habits don\\\\\\'t change and Ace does all he can to help her out. The love story in this is amazing. Ginger is unlikeable but we can\\\\\\'t turn away from her. Her and Nicky both contribute to Ace\\\\\\'s fall as well as the rise of other casinos in Vegas.One easy thing I loved was the performance by Robert De Niro. He is very likable and my heart breaks every time he is screwed over by Ginger and Nicky. He was easily a better lead than Ray Liotta and his character was more likable and deeper than Jimmy. In fact, all three of our leads in this are much deeper developed than the leads in Goodfellas. Ray Liotta is a dummy who is not cut out to be a mobster, while we see the conviction in Ace as he tries to make everything work out. Casino is also much more flashy and nicer too look at than Goodfellas which takes place in New York. The music in this is not distracting or overpowering. The filming is a step up. the flow is much better. And the story is superior. This has more of a linear and stable story than Goodfellas, which is just a man\\\\\\'s escapades in the mafia. Everybody that watches Casino is impacted more than Goodfellas. To watch Casino, you have to be in a mood and well prepared. A movie has really done its job if it does that to a viewer, and actually has a purpose for its content.4/4\\', \\'A complex, multilayered, beautifully directed film, Martin Scorsese\\\\\\'s Casino is a masterpiece of destruction and betrayal. Few films take so many chances and succeed so wonderfully. It takes some of the basic formulas that were found in Goodfellas and applies them to another type of story - while Goodfellas\\\\\\' view was ground-level, telling the story of the \"blue collar\" gangsters of NYC, this film tells the story of the guys who controlled those guys. And it\\\\\\'s fascinating to watch these people run Las Vegas, control the flow of money, and then fall from the heights of power due to lust, hubris, and greed. An amazing film that will hopefully get the recognition it deserves in the years to come.\\', \\'Based on a true story, Martin Scorsese \"Casino\" is a motion picture about two characters and their chance to rule the desert paradise of Las Vegas\\\\x85 We are introduced in with all the lights, the noise, the flashing and the colors of the town that doesn\\\\\\'t sleep day or night\\\\x85 De Niro\\\\\\'s character, Sam \\\\\\'Ace\\\\\\' Rothstein, is based on Frank \"Lefty\" Rosenthal, who was a hell of a handicapper\\\\x85 He was so good that whenever he bets, he could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country\\\\x85 Genius at what he was doing with numbers, he proved to a lot of guys in the Chicago Mob that he was a tremendous earner that he could make a lot of money for them\\\\x85 As a result, he was able to accomplish whatever bookmaking, handicapping, he wanted to do, with the umbrella of protection from those guys\\\\x85 \\\\\\'Ace\\\\\\' runs the casino with an iron fist refusing any outside people cheating at his tables\\\\x85But he had a fatal flaw\\\\x85 \\\\\\'Ace\\\\\\' always felt that he could logically and intelligently deal with things, even to deal with emotions\\\\x85 So he decides on making a life with a woman who, he knows, does not necessarily love him\\\\x85 Anyway with such a sexy wife and money to burn, \\\\\\'Ace\\\\\\' was the epitome of opulence, confidence and power\\\\x85 Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) was fascinating\\\\x85 Great woman, truly beautiful, one of the best-known hustlers in town\\\\x85 For her, a guy like \\\\\\'Ace\\\\\\' was the ultimate score\\\\x85 So the way to Ginger\\\\\\'s heart was clearly money\\\\x85 \\\\\\'Ace\\\\\\' knew that but he didn\\\\\\'t care\\\\x85What he wanted was to marry her\\\\x85 Sharon Stone really stood up to the challenge in her role as a casino hustler who is so wild\\\\x85 She was young, fresh, confident, looking absolutely fantastic as the independent woman whom everybody desires\\\\x85Joe Pesci succeeds in his scary tough role as the strong man who has nerve, and isn\\\\\\'t afraid of the cops\\\\x85 He was reportedly a mob hit man reputed to be a sadistic killer\\\\x85 (In one scene, his character is shown torturing someone by putting his head in a vise.) To protect his friend and adviser, Nicky (Pesci) would beat to a pulp any street guys who messed with \\\\\\'Ace\\\\\\' or didn\\\\\\'t give him the proper respect\\\\x85 Over the course of their friendship Nicky delivered a number of these messages always making sure that \\\\\\'Ace\\\\\\' didn\\\\\\'t get his hands dirty\\\\x85 \\\\\\'Ace\\\\\\' witnessed several beatings on his behalf\\\\x85 Nicky\\\\\\'s mission was to show his worth to the family as an enforcer\\\\x85The clothes on De Niro looked very straight, more dangerous and very threatening\\\\x85 They were very important cues to his character, and again, to the progression of the story\\\\x85 \\\\\\'Ace\\\\\\' was an extremely fastidious guy\\\\x85 And, of course, as you follow the story he starts out in more conservative colors and as things become more chaotic, the colors become more chaotic\\', \\'Martin Scorsese\\\\\\'s Casino has all the ingredients for a great crime film. It\\\\\\'s got hits, bad language, Robert DeNiro, gambling, lots of Italian Americans - it\\\\\\'s all there. Furthermore, it\\\\\\'s got a great soundtrack, the Las Vegas setting makes for a great location and the acting is largely very good...but somehow, this just isn\\\\\\'t a great film. Scorsese has missed the mark thanks to a lack of emotion. There is no reason to care for the characters in this movie, and that makes the film hard to connect with on the whole. The movie also follows the common Scorsese format, in that some guy gets rich and respected, then something bad happens and he finds himself back where he started. In fact, the ending of this movie is only an \"I\\\\\\'m a schmo\" away from being a complete copy of Goodfellas. Still, at least the movie manages to stay interesting for most of it\\\\\\'s runtime, and it\\\\\\'s easy to forgive the flaws when you\\\\\\'re watching Joe Pesci threatening someone who\\\\\\'s head he\\\\\\'s jammed into a vice.Casino lasts almost three hours, and it\\\\\\'s fair to say therefore that this movie is overlong. It\\\\\\'s not so bad for the first two hours, but once the film enters the final third; cracks begin to appear and the film isn\\\\\\'t as interesting as it was, not much unlike Goodfellas; which also suffered from a trite final third. Tarantino\\\\\\'s influence on cinema is felt in this movie, and that is obvious from the way that Scorsese has seen fit to saturate the movie in \\\\\\'cool\\\\\\' old classics. Still, some of these songs; such as Fleetwood Mac\\\\\\'s \"Go Your Own Way\" and The Animals\\\\\\' \"The House of the Rising Sun\" are really good songs and actually bode well with the action on screen. For this movie, Martin Scorsese has re-recruited the excellent pairing of Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci, and both give their trademark excellent performances in this film. Casino may well be DeNiro\\\\\\'s last great performance before he went on his downward spiral, which started with the fellow 1995 movie \"Heat\". On the whole, while this film is technically sound, it lacks emotional bite and there will be times during the film when your interest will trail off. It\\\\\\'s an entertaining ride, but it\\\\\\'s one that is ultimately shallow.\\', \\'I have to admit my bias, because I believe that Scorcese cannot do wrong - ever.  Even his lesser-known or critically panned films are above the \"great film\" line, and Casino is certainly no exception. Casino spans three decades and chronicles the true story of a faction of the mob who ran Las Vegas casinos.  Robert DeNiro plays Ace Rothstein, a fantastic bookie who is chosen to run the Tangiers hotel and casino.  Along the way, he marries a drug-addicted con-artist trophy wife (Sharon Stone) and struggles with his friendship with loose-cannon Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci).  Rothstein is a complicated figure in that he is not a heavy, yet he wields a lot of power due to the respect he has gained from his mob bosses back home.  Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci are both fantastic in their roles, and Sharon Stone actually turned out a non-irritating performance.  As the viewer, you can\\\\\\'t stand her, but that is the point.  Scorcese\\\\\\'s normal supporting cast are also involved in this film, including his great mother - even though she usually has incredibly minimal roles, they are always memorable.\\\\nScorcese seems to have several different directing styles, and Casino follows in the tradition of Goodfellas as a pseudo-documentary.  A lot of the exposition is revealed by the characters themselves in the form of voice-overs, and several scenes are filmed in documentarian fashion.  The entire production however, is sleek and very quick.  The use of music bears mentioning as well: Most Martin Scorcese films have an amazing soundtrack that adds to and enhances the scene.  Being a child of the MTV age, I\\\\\\'m a sucker for good uses of music in films and Scorcese is a master.  Scorcese doesn\\\\\\'t just utilize the soundtrack, he makes it part of the storytelling - by the music, we chronologically know what time period we are witnessing, since one cannot rely on other factors, such as fashion alone.  One of my favorite scenes in film which effectively involves music is actually from Casino - the very intense scene when the relationship between DeNiro, Stone and Pesci come to a head in the climax of the film. The pounding music cut throughout this scene is a cover of \"Satisfaction\" by Devo and the result is absolutely brilliant.  Being a complete film geek, I generally don\\\\\\'t go to films that feature certain stars, I go to films by certain directors and Scorcese is one of them.  While this was probably the tenth time I\\\\\\'d seen this film there were more things I noticed, and I\\\\\\'m sure I\\\\\\'ll notice more upon my eleventh viewing.  The man is a complete genius, and a gift to film - my suggestion is to watch some of his films, then check out his unbelievable series, \"A Personal Journey with Martin Scorcese Through American Movies\" which was done the same year as Casino.  The series is essentially a primer on the history of film, sectioned off by film genres.  You not only will experience his amazing intellect and massive knowledge of film history, but his incredible humility as well.--Shelly\\', \"If you haven\\'t seen Casino yet, stop whatever it is you\\'re doing, rush to the nearest video store, rent it, and watch it.  Along with Mean Streets Casino is probably Scorsese\\'s most underrated and unheralded picture.  I would also venture to say that this is probably his most ambitious film. The film deals with a particular time period and a particular atmosphere and accomplishes an overwhelming achievement by creating and accurately portraying both.  The art direction is splendid, most likely the best of any film Scorsese has ever done.  The acting is superb.  I never thought Pesci would be able to top his dynamic performance in Raging Bull until I saw Casino.  Every time I watch this picture I fall in love with it all over again.  This is the most honest depiction of Las Vegas, especially of the time period it was portrayed in.  Scorsese\\'s direction is flawless. Perhaps it is because I watch alot of Scorsese and Kubrick films, but I am becoming less satisfied with plot driven films and more enamored by films that possess the freedom that typical stories just don\\'t seem to hold.  Sharon Stone gives the best performance of her career, and as far as the editing is concerned, well if you believe like Kubrick and Pudovkin that a film is not shot, but built who better to have on your team than long time cohort, collaborator, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker.  Ultimately, the genius of Scorsese is not just in the mastery of the medium, but in the understanding and appreciation for the necessity of great collaborators on all levels that Scorsese has consistently utilized throughout his career.  Casino exemplifies not only the best of a Scorsese film, but transcends it.  This film is truly a gem.\", \\'Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci team up again for a amazing movie with unforgettable performances.The film portrays Las Vegas at a time when it was dominated by the mafia, extremely well directed by Scorsese, that film shows Robert De Niro as manager of the Tangiers Casino who have to deal with his unstable wife that used to be a high-class prostitute but who can not forget her pimp Lester and with his childhood friend Nicky that is taking the city with extreme uncontrolled violence bringing a bad image to the plans that the mafia has in Las Vegas.Sharon Stone definitely give the best performance of her career in this film and the secondary characters convey very well the image of the great leaders of the mafia.Casino is a classic and a must-see movie.\\']',\n",
              "       '[\"Whoever says they just don\\'t make the quality of pictures today that they used to hasn\\'t seen or is ignoring this film.That Emma Thompson is one of the greatest actresses working is no secret. But who would have expected such a miracle from her in the screenwriting department? Some of the most dramatic moments in \\'Sense and Sensibility\\' come from her pen, not Jane Austen\\'s, difficult as that may be to believe. For instance, the scene in which Col. Brandon (Alan Rickman) carries in the ill Marianne Dashwood (Kate Winslet), echoing the earlier scene where Willoughby (Greg Wise) brought the injured young woman home was Thompson\\'s doing. Marianne\\'s illness also is responsible for much more drama in the movie than in the book. And I\\'m an Austen fan! I can\\'t recall another writer bringing so much good of his or her own to a classic like this.I suppose the director, cinematographer, production designer, etc. deserve to share the credit when a movie is this outstanding, but with such a super group of actors on the screen (from top to bottom) it\\'s easy to heap all the praise on them. I had unconsciously (and unfairly) pigeonholed Alan Rickman based on the other role I\\'d seen him in, the villain in \\'Die Hard,\\' so he was quite a surprise to me. The real bombshell, however, was my first exposure to Kate Winslet. After seeing this movie and Kenneth Branagh\\'s \\'Hamlet\\' I can say I can\\'t remember another young actress who has impressed me so much. And she played these difficult roles by the time she was 20! Many of the other cast members are a part of an excellent group that Thompson and Branagh have often worked with in the past.I realized that \\'S&S\\' had become one of my all-time favorite movies when I found myself watching it every chance I got when it came on TV. I think it\\'s bumped \\'Raging Bull\\' off my personal top 10 list.\", \"Wow, here\\'s an emotional story that gets you involved and wears you out by the end. I wears you out not from action, but from watching two good ladies suffer heartbreaks one after the other. This is not my normal viewing fare but I am big fan of two things this movie has to offer: (1) Emma Thompson and (2) incredible visuals.Few people were better in the 1990s at playing the sensible-sweet-wholesome and pretty and-always unfairly ignored woman than Thompson (see The Remains Of The Day and Howards End). Your heart aches for this woman whose characters always deserve better than what they receive.. Her facial expressions alone convey pain better than anyone I\\'ve ever seen on film. This is perhaps her best work and it was justice she was honored for it. It was refreshing to see Alan Rickman actually place a nice guy and Kate Winslet was appealing, too - a far cry from spoiled brat role in the film that gave her stardom, Titantic.One tip that I found useful in watching this movie. If you are not British, you might switch on the English subtitles to better understand the dialog and the phraseology of early 19th century England, in which this story takes place.The only problem with using the subtitles is that it detracts from marveling at these visuals. This is one of the prettiest films I have ever seen, on both the inside and outside scenes. It\\'s just gorgeous cinematography frame after frame with beautiful colors. Nice music score, too.This kind of story is a bit too soap opera-like for my normal tastes but to watch Thompson and to ogle the colors, sets and scenery makes it all a rewarding experience. For women who like these kind of Jane Austen stories, this must really be a special film. For the rest of us, it\\'s still very much worth seeing, and adding to one\\'s DVD collection. It\\'\\'s great film-making.\", \\'I haven\\\\\\'t read the book (yet), but concerning the film as it is, I can assure you that it is very well made. You\\\\\\'ll get one of the best period dramas (I wouldn\\\\\\'t go all the way with \"best ever\", but then again, I don\\\\\\'t often use extremes to describe a movies) that you have seen! Of course you have to be open to this kind of movie. Meaning, that if you\\\\\\'re more likely to watch Bruce Willis in Die Hard or can\\\\\\'t wait for the next Steven Seagal movie, this might not be your cup of tea! There is a strong possibility that you won\\\\\\'t like (to watch) this movie at all.So if you have seen period dramas and like them, than watch this one too, if you haven\\\\\\'t watched one yet, than this can be a perfect movie to start with (although some might say, it\\\\\\'s downhills after that ;o) )\\', \\'What an excellent film! Superb performances, spellbinding dialogue, and beautiful sets and props led to an enchanting 2 hours of lost love and hope. I loved the stiffly formal, wonderfully polite, yet stifling mores these English were forced to endure. In many cases their lives were not their own to live; in many, their lives were lived under the gun of the almighty buck. They carried right on, however, with their characteristically stiff English upper lip, come what may. Great film with a knockout ending.\\', \\'If it wasn\\\\\\'t for Jane Austen\\\\\\'s novels and their screen-adaptation, we wouldn\\\\\\'t be much familiar with the English gallantry and the bourgeois manners of the early 19th century. Her oeuvre encapsulated a time where women didn\\\\\\'t have a way to go through life without landing on the \"marriage\" square, hardly an issue to please feminists but who would call Austen traditional or submissive for all that? She respected the conventions but made powerful social commentaries in the indirect sense that her female protagonists never married someone they didn\\\\\\'t love. Marriage was the end, but love was the means to achieve it, while marriage of convenience was the privilege of the mediocre ones.Now, there is an interesting point of comparison between her two most celebrated novels: \"Sense and Sensibility\" and \"Pride and Prejudice\". \"Sense\" was Austen\\\\\\'s first success, written at a very young age, yet it deals with characters evolving in the realm of adulthood, while in \"Pride\", written by an older Austen, the heroines are the Bennett Sisters who aren\\\\\\'t older than twenty. It is just like Austen was a painter who had to go to the top of the mountain to have a clear view on a plain after having painted the mountain from the plain. With enough experience and wisdom, she was able to make a brighter portrait of a young generation who get the man through their actions. In \"Sense\", the Dashwood sisters are fully-dimensional characters, Elinor (Emma Thompson) is reserved and introverted while Marianne (Kate Winslet) is romantic and flamboyant, they\\\\\\'re more mature than the Bennetts sisters, but at the expense of their reactivity.In \"Pride\", luck and men\\\\\\'s valiance were not elements to count on, and many round trips allowed the heroine to confront her suitor. It is possible that \"Pride\" was a bit too modern while \"Sense\" was more obedient to the perception of women\\\\\\'s role at the time (rather static), but the directing by Ang Lee and the screenplay worked in such a way that the quest for marriage isn\\\\\\'t actually the most interesting part of the film. And while I don\\\\\\'t think I give away the ending by saying that each one will find the true love, it\\\\\\'s obviously not the point of suspense; the real question is how these people interact. And just like your typical Austen\\\\\\'s stories, there\\\\\\'s a good deal of passions and deception, or romantic studs popping up at the right moment and forcing the women to all align in the house to promptly welcome their host. Some are dark and brooding (Alan Rickman) other shy and amiable (Hugh Grant) and a few too perfect to be true (Greg Wise) but they all have one thing in common, they\\\\\\'re conveniently called to office in London whenever marriage seems too close, a snobby bitch or karma playing the same game postponing the overdue rendezvous with destiny.But as predictable as these films are, their quality is elsewhere, starting with the acting. Literary movies have this quality that the abundance of words and plots can sometimes distract from simpler moments that actually elevate them more than any monologue or speech. This moment occurs when Edward (Grant), is ready to confess something to Elinor. They have spent enough time together to grow a deep feeling. He\\\\\\'s about to say something about his\\\\x85 you expect the word \"feeling\", he says \"education\", and you can see something click in the blink of an eye in Thompson\\\\\\'s face, \\\\\\'devastation\\\\\\' as it would really show in a woman who learned to hide her feelings. There\\\\\\'s no doubt that Emma Thompson is one of the greatest actress of her generation. On the other hand, Marianne will also face abandon and the reaction will fit her passionate personality. While, the plot in itself can be summed up by women waiting for the right men to come, so (God forbid), they don\\\\\\'t end up as bitter spinster, there is more to enjoy, the text and more importantly, the subtext.And on that level, Jane Austen\\\\\\'s stories are exhilarating hymns for eloquence and literacy, whether when the characters write intimate correspondences, share their personal thoughts with their friends or relatives or try to convey a strong message by still respecting the conveniences, I just can\\\\\\'t resist by the way Shakespeare\\\\\\'s language is being honored. You finish the film and you just want to express your feelings with the same economy of obviousness or flamed passion when called for, and a similar urge generally invade me when I finish the Ivory and Merchant movies. There is something just irresistible in these British heritage films, they make you realize how close we still are to these times by the scale of history, but light-years ahead as far as mediocrity and plainness is concerned.And it\\\\\\'s a credit to Austen\\\\\\'s writing and Thompsons\\\\\\'s rewriting (earning her an Oscar) to have translated the story in a tone that wouldn\\\\\\'t make feminists\\\\\\' neck hair stand up and wouldn\\\\\\'t portray men as misogynistic pigs.The film says something important: the strength of your character doesn\\\\\\'t depend on what he or she accomplishes but how it can strongly affect your own feeling or how can they resist the cruelties of life without necessarily triumphing over them. All through the film, I was totally rooting for Marianne, Elinor, their mother (Gemma Jones) and the way they endorsed or rebelled against conventions at crucial times where simpler things were complicatedly expressed. Indeed, everything that happened is due to something said, a promise or a misunderstanding. It\\\\\\'s all in the way words are used, misused or distorted and that\\\\\\'s one of the many delights in this lavish movie.\\', \\'It\\\\\\'s not easy to get seniors to do anything, even watch a movie and when you mention Jane Austen, they zone out. Yet each year when we do this film in class, about 80 percent end up loving it and that includes the guys. It\\\\\\'s wonderful to watch them respond to the characters and get into a film that is so \"talky\" when they have been used to high action. To hear the girls call Willoughby a jerk and applaud Brandon at the end is great, but to listen to the boys comment on the behavior of the various characters is even better. How they respond to a society so filled with strict manners and codes of behavior also makes this film worthwhile and it generates much discussion about the importance of money in life; well, even Thompson in the commentary said the film is about money, who has it and who does not. I love showing this film to my students; after the groans when I start it on the first day, it\\\\\\'s wonderful to hear their comments on day five when we finish. As one senior male said this year, \"I wouldn\\\\\\'t have rented this or wanted to see it, but now that I have, I admit it was pretty good, so I\\\\\\'m glad you showed it.\" This is why they are classics, kiddies.\\', \\'I found \"Sense and Sensibilty\" to be one of the most charming movies I have seen since \"Finding Neverland\". It has a very warm feeling and is very welcoming. The story is absolutely beautiful. In the 1990\\\\\\'s, all of Jane Austen\\\\\\'s huge novels were made into movies and some even in television series. Most of them were very good, but Sense and Sensibility really stood out and was the best. Most thanks to Emma Thompson and her brilliant screenplay, which was also her first. Kudos to her, she seems like a fine and intelligent woman. I found out that this screenplay took her about 4 years to have the final draft done. She also couldn\\\\\\'t translate some of the novel into the book so she took some of Austen\\\\\\'s letters and put them into the movie.The acting is absolutely on key and all of the actors fit quite well into their roles. I enjoy period pieces thourelly, if you don\\\\\\'t, you might want to skip it. But I would recommend this picture any day. It\\\\\\'s very beautiful and a wonderful movie to watch. It has some of the finest British actors: Allen Rickman, Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, and Hugh Grant. So give it a chance, I think you\\\\\\'ll be pleasantly surprised.10/10\\', \\'This is a remarkable film that does a very good job of depicting a rigid and quite hidebound society that often made India\\\\\\'s caste system look reasonable and moderate by comparison.  One of the more enjoyable points for me was the fact that the \"sense and sensibility\" of the title had a most definite 19th Century feel and yet still remains very timeless and does not attempt to force Twentieth Century mores (probably by use of a crowbar) into a script where they do not belong.  Modern day viewpoints do not belong here.  If you want a modern day version, fine.  But it would be, at best, only a glancing and quite loose adaptation of the novel, so why do an adaptation at all, then?  Not all films have to reflect present day sensibilities.  This is a very human and compelling story with a fine cast and wonderfully witty script.  Look for a very dry and understated performance by Hugh Laurie as Mr. Palmer, the long-suffering husband of the daughter of Mrs. Jennings. Were I Mr. Palmer, I\\\\\\'d have long since invested in earplugs or opened a vein.  Very fine film and most highly recommended.\\', \"This is one of the best of the recent Jane Austen films, from one of her weaker books. Emma Thompson has done a fine job of the script, not slavishly remaining faithful to the book but not abandoning it either.The cast are uniformally excellent. I especially liked Kate Winslet\\'s Marianne and Alan Rickman\\'s Brandon. Emma Thompson\\'s performance is almost good enough to make you forget that she is far to old for the part. The supporting cast are all excellent.Ang Lee\\'s direction shows the same skill that it did in the excellent Eat Drink Man Woman and the scenery and costumes are beautiful (perhaps too beautiful).This is more romantic and less comic than say Emma, and Thompson\\'s script wisely stays away from the kind of set-piece gags seen in the recent film of Emma. All in all, this is excellent.\"]',\n",
              "       '[\"It\\'s a pity that the critics gave \\'Four Rooms\\' as hard a time as they did back in 1995, because, for everything that can be said to be wrong with it, it really does sparkle with creativity and a desire to stand out from the rest of the crowd. And let\\'s face it, there was enough popular talent involved, including Alison Anders, Alexandre Rockwell, Robert Rodriguez and, last but not least, Quentin Tarantino, for it to have been hailed as an instant cult classic. Instead, it was bashed into submission and retreated very quickly to the back of nearly everyone\\'s resume. With retrospect most of this reproach was probably ill-deserved - \\'Four Rooms\\' does have its blatant moments of weakness, but then again so do a lot of the more half-baked cookie-cutter comedies which have somehow garnered more admiration than this. On the whole it\\'s a very unusual and interesting combination - an offbeat, frisky and strangely feel-good comedy with some sinister undertones and lots of weird, intricate little details. Consisting of four 20-minute segments, each assembled by a different director\\'s hands, it takes us through the various happenings inside separate rooms of the same hotel on New Year\\'s Eve, as experienced by Ted, the only bellhop still left standing for the night shift. There is the slight feeling of inconsistency in moving from one directing style to the next, and a couple of attempts to interconnect the segments are a little self-contradictory. Some of it works and some it doesn\\'t, but the end result is an episodic anthology that, if nothing too spectacular, still proves itself to be very likable in the long run.\\'The Missing Ingredient\\' and \\'the Wrong Man\\' are often credited with constituting the weaker half of the film, and I can\\'t really say I disagree. \\'The Missing Ingredient\\' tries hard to be risqué, but falls pretty short - for a story concerning a coven of bare-breasted witches trying to extract an unwilling man\\'s semen for use in a ritual, it\\'s remarkably innocuous and fluffy, and the visual effects only add a layer of tackiness to boot. \\'The Wrong Man\\' is a tad more snappy and sports some stylish direction (the shot where Sigfried grabs the ringing telephone is right-on), but is ultimately swallowed up in its frenzied editing. We can vaguely understand what\\'s happening in this segment (if not, then Ted does drop a pretty big hint later on in the film), but it makes itself unnecessarily incoherent, with bizarre imagery that adds nothing but extra confusion (the baby flashback, anyone?). It\\'s almost as though Alexandre Rockwell isn\\'t sure whether he wants us to be in on the whole set-up with Sigfried and Angela, or confused and in the dark like Ted, and in the end tries to accommodate both perspectives, which doesn\\'t really wash.It\\'s once we reach the second half that the true quality really starts to seep its way in, and the film suddenly becomes very rewarding. \\'The Misbehaviours\\' is a spirited little contribution that combines a moderate dose of macabre darkness with its cartoon-like innocence. Antonio Banderas certainly hits a good spot as the no-nonsense father who appoints Ted to keep an eye on his two young children while he\\'s out, whilst the children themselves are rebellious but not irritating, all making for a surprisingly sharp and sophisticated slice of knockabout. \\'The Man from Hollywood\\', meanwhile, is equally brilliant - Tarantino\\'s vibrant, well-scripted take on Roald Dahl\\'s chilling short story, \\'the Man from the South\\', which pits Ted in the same room as cocky Hollywood director Chester Rush (and it\\'s always a treat to see Quentin himself tackle such a winking, self-depreciating role). It manages to be tense and enjoyable, with the usual smart direction that any Tarantino fan should be able to appreciate. Overall, there\\'s enough vitality in these particular segments to just about redeem the shakiness of the first half.Besides, we have Tim Roth playing our hapless protagonist throughout, and, yes, that is a lot. He proves himself to be very capable in a comic performance, bringing enough gentle magnetism to his character Ted the bellhop, through his good intentions, perseverance and various neurotic mannerisms, to get us genuinely attached to him. It is hard not to come away with the impression that all four directors had a slightly different take on Ted\\'s disposition - he goes from being timid and impressionable to obtuse and jumpy, then highly-strung and a little devious, and finally composed and relatively rational - but Roth does well in single-handedly bridging these gaps and, with the many mishaps his character has to endure over the course of the night, ensures that all changes in temper seem understandable. He retains his good-natured lovability for the entire running time, and, for anyone who can really relate to poor Ted (like yours truly), he\\'ll have you rooting for him to the very satisfying end.To my knowledge, there was never any other film quite like \\'Four Rooms\\' and, judging by just how unwelcome this one was made to feel when it arrived, there probably won\\'t be another for quite some time. It remains an ambitious and not entirely successful little sleeper, but has a good deal going for it nonetheless, and I urge all fans of Tarantino, Rodriguez and Roth in particular not to be put off by the bad press and to give it a chance. Who knows? One day, it might just make a fresh start and find the cult audience that appreciates it yet.\", \\'Four Rooms was concocted like one of those many, many collaborative efforts from directors in the 60\\\\\\'s and 70\\\\\\'s (i.e. The Witches, Ro.Go.PaG, Boccaccio \\\\\\'70, etc), except this would revolve around a bell-hop on New Years Eve. It disqualifies itself as being any kind of masterpiece or classic in independent film-making, and sometimes the filmmakers (Alison Anders, Robert Rodriguez, and Alexandre Rockwell, and Quentin Tarantino, the last two also serving as executive producer) look like they\\\\\\'re relishing too much in their (limited) clout and exuberance to concentrate. As was with many others who viewed the film, I found that the first two segments were the lesser ones, and the last two were the best ones. It all comes down, in this case, to which two were funnier. So, let\\\\\\'s break each one down:Allison Anders\\\\\\' film is a quirky, quasi-lesbian take on a coven of witches, featuring the likes of Madonna and Lily Taylor, are the first to shake up (perhaps for the better in this one) Ted the bell-hop. Ted, by the way, is played with a continuous, nervous-type of fervor that goes from being innocuous, to annoying, and then acceptable again. It\\\\\\'s also interesting to see how his character goes through different motions when under each director (for example, in Rodriguez\\\\\\'s film he\\\\\\'s more of a cartoon-type of character, and in Tarantino\\\\\\'s film he hearkens slightly to his previous collaborations with the director, quieter, on edge in a particular way). Some of the laughs are surrounded by a kind of attitude put forth by the director that seems a little off. Maybe I\\\\\\'m the wrong audience for it, though- the women in the audience may appreciate it, or rather amused by it, more than I. I give it a B-Alexandre Rockwell\\\\\\'s The Wrong Man is my least favorite of the bunch, as Ted gets stuck with a couple of crazed fetishists (David Proval and Jennifer Beals). The problem here lies with two things- the fact that the comedic timing/chemistry is a little iffy/off with the three actors, and that the writing doesn\\\\\\'t come off like it\\\\\\'s naturally funny. When Beals\\\\\\' character Angela runs off about Ted\\\\\\'s private parts, this could be funny, but it\\\\\\'s more \\\\\\'ho-ho\\\\\\' than \\\\\\'ha-ha\\\\\\' to me. Some of the tension from Roth brings some laughs, but not enough to compensate the uncomfortable atmosphere around the whole segment. I give it a C-The third segment, The Misbehaviors, displays how clever and quick Rodriguez can be with physical comedy (slapstick) as well as in getting laughs from kids (as he did here and there in his Spy Kids movies). It is also a boost that the whole segment comes off as though it\\\\\\'s like a live-action Looney Tunes short- it\\\\\\'s so ridiculous that in some scenes I burst out laughing (i.e. Ted\\\\\\'s reaction to the corpse). The set-up with the parents was also amusing in how Banderas and Tamlyn Tomita act towards the kids. Then the pay-off knocks it out of the park. Grade: AThen we come to the closure, featuring the indie wunderkind at the time, Tarantino, as he takes on two sources of inspiration- Rohald Dahl\\\\\\'s \"Man from the South\" short story, later translated through Alfred Hitchcock\\\\\\'s television show. It\\\\\\'s a smart, hip little piece of Hollywood satire from Tarantino, as he himself plays an overly obnoxious Hollywood filmmaker, with two guys by his side (Paul Calderon and Bruce Willis), as they take a gamble right after the stroke of midnight. It took me a couple of time to watch this to really get into it, but when I did it was even more promising. The camera-work in the scene (via \\\\\\'Dogs\\\\\\' and \\\\\\'Pulp\\\\\\' cinematographer Andrzej Sekula) is deliberately paced, and it\\\\\\'s perfectly leisurely for the pace of the last segment. That much, if not all, of the dialog is funny it\\\\\\'s because of the skill and chemistry between the four of them. Plus, a little prologue with Marisa Tomei and Kathy Griffin gives the indication of what insanity is in store. Grade- A.So, is this film a success? For it\\\\\\'s time, I\\\\\\'m not sure. With the power of four million off the success of each director\\\\\\'s previous efforts (Tarantino with \\\\\\'Dogs\\\\\\', Rodriguez with El Mariachi, Anders with Gas, Food, and Lodging, and Rockwell with In the Soup, all from the 92 Sundance place), they did whatever they wanted, and it\\\\\\'s not the success it could\\\\\\'ve been. On the other hand, when one looks at the films in perspective, it could\\\\\\'ve been a lot worse, and it wasn\\\\\\'t. At the least, it works as one of the quintessential party movies for fans of the 90\\\\\\'s \"new-wave\" crop.\\', \\'It\\\\\\'s impossible to analyze this film without breaking it down into its four segments for separate comment.  It would also be improper, since it was not intended to be anything less than an anthology from four notable independent filmmakers:  Alexandre Rockwell, Alison Anders, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino.The first episode is exactly the sort of thing that someone in a high school drama production would want to do, but can\\\\\\'t get away with in a high school drama production.  It\\\\\\'s juvenile, unfunny, and lifeless, but it has the (pointless) nudity and lines of dialogue like:Witch #1:  \"I am your mother.\"Witch #2:  \"Then why are we sleeping together?\"that sound like the screenwriter is giggling and thinking, \"I can\\\\\\'t believe I\\\\\\'m getting away with this!  I\\\\\\'m so clever!\"Nothing is at stake in the first episode;  it\\\\\\'s generally expected that a story must have conflict in order to BE a story.  This has none.  Just some half-baked jokes and a pair of topless women (If I wanted that, I\\\\\\'d skip renting a movie and go out instead.)Second episode is a hair better, but you\\\\\\'ll find yourself crying \"Why doesn\\\\\\'t Ted the Bellboy do [insert plot resolution here] and get the bloody hell out of there!\"  When it finally does end, you\\\\\\'re disheartened to find that it had no reason to exist.  Two snips with a pair of scissors,  a bit of tape, and we wouldn\\\\\\'t know the difference.  Roll opening credits, go straight to the Rodriguez segment.Third episode has some structural support to keep it from caving in on itself.  The surprise in the middle (I won\\\\\\'t give it away, don\\\\\\'t worry) is horrifying enough to give the segment some heft.  Rodriguez and his d.p., Guillermo Navarro, move it along dexterously and (as usual) have a good handle on visual comedy.The last segment is the best.  I think it\\\\\\'s safe to say that Quentin Tarantino has, officially, never disappointed me as a director or screenwriter.  My heart leapt as soon as I heard his trademark dialogue coming from the lips of Marisa Tomei as \"Four Rooms\" segued from \"The Misbehavers\" to \"The Man From Hollywood.\"  I wasn\\\\\\'t sure if his take on Ted the Bellhop\\\\\\'s misadventures was going to be any good, but I knew that if he wrote it and helmed it, it wasn\\\\\\'t going to be all bad.What a pleasant surprise (still just talking about the fourth segment here). This part of the movie, with its ridiculous premise (lifted form an old Hitchcock episode, which it acknowledges out loud), moves along speedily, and the actors take to it as naturally as any other movies by Q.T. Basically playing himself, Tarantino is hilarious.  If anything, he knows A) how people really act when they\\\\\\'re drunk (i.e. not like Dudley Moore caricatures)  B) why people think he\\\\\\'s so obnoxious, like a real-life, fast-talking Jar Jar Binks and  C) how to put some bang in his visual storytelling.  It\\\\\\'s low-rent Tarantino, don\\\\\\'t get me wrong, but it\\\\\\'s also the best part of \"Four Rooms.\"All in all, the first film I\\\\\\'ve ever seen that starts out with a loathsome, horrifying badness, gets incrementally better with each passing fifteen minutes, and ends as good as one would like.  Just don\\\\\\'t make me watch it again.\\', \\'\"Four Rooms\" is far more entertaining than you would expect from its generally negative reviews. Which is not to say that any of it is a masterpiece but if you enjoyed \"Love American Style\" on television and are not put off by a raunchy take on that anthology concept you should make an effort to view this film. Each story is taking place in a different room of a hotel the same night. It was made between the time Tarantino made \"Pulp Fiction\" and worked on \"Dusk Till Dawn\" with Rodriquez. Many in the large cast are Tarantino and Rodriquez regulars. Here are a few of the reasons to watch each of the four stories:\"The Missing Ingredient\" - Madona has simply never looked better and her \"come get me\" dress will burn your eyeballs. Alicia Witt plays her stock alienated teen and delivers sarcasm as only she can.\"The Wrong Man\" – Alexander Rockwell directed this segment shortly after directing \"In the Soup\" so he already knew how to get the most out of Jennifer Beals. Her diatribe about Ted\\\\\\'s sex organ is a cinema classic.\"The Misbehavers\" – Rodriquez directs his favorite actor Antonio Banderas in something that is a throwback to classic Laurel and Hardy. Not only do his two kids misbehave when left alone in their hotel room, but their misbehavior is so comprehensive that the closing shot reveals a room of total anarchy. It is wonderful slapstick on a huge scale, with comic timing worthy of the Laural and Hardy and the Marx Brothers.\"The Man From Hollywood\" – This has the best script with Tarantino reserving the best stuff for his own character. He even reprises the \"tasty beverage\" line from \"Pulp Fiction. Beals has already found her way to this room by the time bellboy Roth arrives and she delivers more good lines. I was impressed that Tarantino built up his suspense \"before\" the contest began and then did not try to extend the suspense but ended things on the first attempt.The best bit in the whole film might be Roth\\\\\\'s phone call to his boss. Marisa Tomei answers the phone in a room full of comatose post-New Years Eve partygoers. She then does a version of her \"My Cousin Vinnie\" expert witness routine, this time concerning types of handguns. In the foreground the entire time are the only other conscious (but totally stoned) inhabitants of the room. They are playing against each other in a video game. One just stares in stunned fascination at the screen, holding the controller but not using it as the other player maniacally manipulates his controller throughout the entire phone conversation.\\', \"I really don\\'t understand why this movie got such bad reviews!  Overall, this is a creative and refreshing movie.  It is not Pulp Fiction but it is still a good performance.  Tim Roth, especially, is the best thing in the film.  Out of the four I like Robert Rodguize\\'s misbehavior the best.  The missing ingredient was indeed a bit cheesy but the rest are still above average performance.  If you are interested in this movie but discouraged by the movie critics, I ensure you that you won\\'t regret seeing it.\", \"Four Rooms, the 4 part directed, 4 part written mix-matched movie turns out to be an awesome combination. With Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino working on this film, you seem to expect a trigger-happy film festival with plenty of bombs and explosives to spare. But what the final product turns out to be is a laugh-out-loud comedy which follows a bellhop\\'s mishaps one night as he scrambles to keep his hotel in order. Tim Roth is always a great performer and in this movie there is no difference. Kudos indeed.\", \\'Four Rooms (1995/Allison Anders; Alexandre Rockwell; Robert Rodriguez; Quentin Tarantino) **1/2 out of ****Welcome to the Mon Signor Hotel! Once a major hang out spot for movie stars of the 30\\\\\\'s, 40\\\\\\'s and first part of the 50\\\\\\'s, it is now an out of date fire hazard, and it is falling apart! But on New Years Eve, a new bellhop will have the craziest night of his life in this very hotel.\\\\nWhen I was thinking of Tarantino flicks to purchase, \"Four Rooms\" came to my mind. At first I was hesitant, and for good reason. After all, I had read nothing but bad reviews for this film. But what I found in it was a bizarre little comedy that wasn\\\\\\'t so bad after all.\"Four Rooms\" is an anthology film with four \\\\\\'episodes\\\\\\' about a fading hotel on News Years Eve, and with a quirky bellhop named Ted (Tim Roth) and his misadventures on this one crazy night. The first episode entitled \"The Missing Ingredient\" is about a group of witches staying in the hotel who need some sperm in order to complete a spell. And guess who knocks on the door...Ted the bellhop! The next episode, \"The Wrong Man\" is a shorter episode about Ted getting mistaken for another man. This is certainly the strangest of the episodes. Then next comes the hilarious \"The Misbehavers\". Ted is asked to babysit two kids of a Mexican gangster (Antonio Banderas in a parody of himself), and how everything possible can go wrong. And the final episode, \"The Man From Hollywood\" (the best) is directed by Quentin Tarantino. It is about a cocky Hollywood new-comer (Tarantino also in a parody of himself) who rents out the Penthouse for New Years Eve, and then plays a dangerous game that ends the film in a very funny way.I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with this film. After reading all the bad reviews, I was afraid I wouldn\\\\\\'t like this it, but it wasn\\\\\\'t as bad as they said. Rent it if your curious or bored, but don\\\\\\'t buy it expecting it to be like other Tarantino films. Not bad, not great, just average.-30-\\', \"Like many I got suckered into watching this film from the list of stars and director/writers (esp Tarantino) that participated in this exercise.I had no idea that it was *this* bad. It starts with the common thread, the bellboy, Tim Roth. It seemed like he was trying to be the British incarnation of Don Knotts trying to be Jerry Lewis. It was one of the most annoying and incomprehensibly bad performances, I\\'ve ever seen from a mainstream actor.He gets no help from what passes for plot. The first two stories seemed like they came from a 10 second pre-improv conference. The third plot was a shaggy dog story that could have worked had it been better executed and the fourth one, Tarantino\\'s, to be fair actually sustained about 5 minutes of interest - unfortunately at the very end of the movie after 90+ minutes of endless torture.Those last 2 plots might have been worthwhile except for the smarmy self-indulgent performances of the stars. Tarantino is not as nearly as clever or funny as he thinks he is, and neither is Willis. The strongest performance might have been that of Banderas who almost rescued the third segment with his self-mocking playfulness.Overall, it felt like I was at one of those bad improv theatres where the actors know the only people in the audience are drunk/stoned friends, family and fanboys. If that doesn\\'t describe you - stay far away from this mess. It really is *that* bad.\", \\'I seem to recall that when \"Four Rooms\" came out, it was critically and commercially derided. When I saw it a few months later, I actually thought that it was pretty well done. I knew that Quentin Tarantino was involved in the making, so I could safely assume that there was an element of sleaze in the movie.Well, the movie is likely to blow anyone away, just in terms of how far they go. Portraying bellhop Ted (Tim Roth) and his loony experiences on New Year\\\\\\'s Eve while waiting on several people in a hotel, they blow everything out of the water. The first two segments are pretty lowbrow: the first one portrays a witches\\\\\\' coven and the second one portrays a psychopath who thinks that Ted had sex with his wife.But when we get to the third segment, that\\\\\\'s where the movie really takes off. Ted has to watch the children of a slick Mexican guy named Man (Antonio Banderas). After a few incidents, Man comes back and finds the room in the most mind-blowing scene imaginable. And, the last segment. Ted, in a totally frenetic state, goes to a room where several Hollywood guys are having a discussion (with as many curse words as possible). What happens at the end of that segment...well, let me just tell you that no one sees that coming! All in all, people who think that the movie didn\\\\\\'t go anywhere obviously missed the point. I don\\\\\\'t know for certain whether this movie was just an excuse to be crazy, but it sure seemed like that. You\\\\\\'re sure to have fun watching it. Also starring Madonna, Valeria Golino, Jennifer Beals, Salma Hayek, and even Quentin Tarantino in the final segment playing a Hollywood type.\\']',\n",
              "       '[\\'Despite most views of this movie, I thought it was just as good as (and in some aspects better than) the original.  Of course there was a lot  of recycled humor, but there was also a lot of original humor too.  I was a little bummed to find out that Courteney Cox wasn\\\\\\'t returning in the second installment, but they did just fine without her.  I doubt it will happen, but I would love to see an Ace Ventura 3 someday.I thought the scene where Ace is trapped inside the animatronic rhino was the funniest scene in the movie, but the film is filled with other great scenes too.  I also loved the fact that he is a lover of all animals, except Bats.  I thought that was such a funny idea for the character.  I mean, what does that say about bats if a lover of all animals can\\\\\\'t even stand them and finds them revolting.  Just thinking about it makes me laugh.  I just love the irony I guess.  Anyhow, there isn\\\\\\'t much more I can say about this film other than if you liked \"Pet Detective\", you should see \"When Nature Calls\". \"Bumble-Bee Tuna\",-Chris\\', \\'Is it dumb? Well, it\\\\\\'s definitely low-brow, but it also has some gags that are undeniably clever. Is it racist? Yeah, a little, but it\\\\\\'s also satirizing old stereotypes about \"Dark Africa.\" Is it immature and and gross and sophomoric and over-the-top? Yes. Yes, it is.But someone (well, me) once said the only thing comedies have to be is funny. And this movie is dang funny. Need I remind anybody of the scene where Ace insists on dropping a slinky down the hundreds of steps leading up to a Buddhist temple? (\"It was RIGHT there!\") Or the slideshow in which Ace\\\\\\'s hand appears to greedily devour a poacher\\\\\\'s crotch? That\\\\\\'s just hilarious!The great thing about this movie is that it doesn\\\\\\'t settle for outlandish set-ups that only seem to be jokes. This movie gets full bang for its comedic buck. Do we have a fight with a crocodile presented in-and-of-itself as humor? No! In a lesser film, perhaps. But Ace Ventura goes the extra mile, bringing us childish schoolyard taunts (\"Stop hittin\\\\\\' yourself! Stop hittin yourself!\") And is it enough to have Ace chasing the villain through the jungle in a monster truck? No - he actually pulls up next to him and utters a bon mot worthy of Groucho. Also, where did that monster truck comefrom?! The sheer resolve not to explain the truck\\\\\\'s presence is a sublimely satirical dig at movies that might place monster trucks in the jungle just for cheap, lazy wackiness.This movie is anything but lazy. Jim Carrey, like no actor before him, pulls out all the stops as Ace Ventura. Is he milking things? Oh sure. He\\\\\\'s milking things like Paganini milked the violin, or like Michelangelo milked the Sistine Chapel. He\\\\\\'s inventing a manic persona so complete and fully realized, that it transcends standard comedy and achieves something mystical and poetic and truthful. And that\\\\\\'s how it keeps from being annoying.This film is too casually dismissed because it looks like a terrible movie. I was hesitant to watch it. But maybe, years and years from now, it will achieve the kind of subversive cult-film status it deserves.\\', \\'I didn\\\\\\'t think the first movie was any great shakes.Sure, it had Carrey in it, running amok and mugging and mimicking and making every rude sound a kid would learn by eighth grade.  But the story just kept getting in the way.That\\\\\\'s why \"When Nature Calls\", in my opinion, is much funnier.The story of securing a sacred bat is neither too intrusive nor annoying and leaves room for gags aplenty.  And Carrey....  Well, he enters a slapstick marathon and wins the gold in every event.  I swear the man is made of rubber.Some of the jokes are pretty gross (the spitting ritual, the \"guano\" references, etc.) but why should that come as any surprise?  Most comedies gear for that kind of humor anymore and, more or less sophisticated, reach the same common denominator: body fluids is funny, dude.Still, without the fluids and functions, there are still great scenes (Ace\\\\\\'s entrance in the dining hall, the monks\\\\\\' reaction to his departure, his behavior at the slide show, his driving habits, his escape from a mechanical rhino) and plenty of opportunities to see Hollywood\\\\\\'s most uninhibited comedian use every conceivable part of his body to make us laugh.I laughed.  His work is done.When this \"Nature\" calls, answer it.Nine stars.  And remember: do not pass go, do not collect $200.\\', \\'I don\\\\\\'t normally respond to these kinds of things, but after reading some of the negative responses I couldn\\\\\\'t help myself. There is a movie out there for everyone, something everyone NEEDs to laugh at and who can relate to. This movie is the opidemy of my humor and the extreme way it portrays the upper crust world of stuffy, snobby, self absorbed unrealistic people who think the world revolves around their view and opinions is classic and makes me laugh in a way that is honest for me.I read that some people were offended by it and want to get others to share their view. All I gotta say is, \"If you didn\\\\\\'t like the first one, why did you go to see the second one? Just to complain?\" Do all of us \"Friends\" of Jim Carey a favor, if you don\\\\\\'t like his humor, just go find some stuffy anal retentive \"fluff\" film, and write reviews on them that we will never read since those movies are for stuck-up self absorbed types. Sorry I just didn\\\\\\'t think it fair that these people are \"Flameing\" this as if there are no other possibilities.Thanx for reading.\\', \\'I like the bit when he comes out of the rhinos butt\\', \\'In this sequel to the very popular \"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\", Ace is in Africa getting into all sorts of silly nonsense. \"Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls\" is definitely a guilty pleasure. While the film is very stupid and never tries to be anything else, it DID make me laugh...much like films like \"Waterboy\" and \"Stepbrothers\". A couple of the dumbest scenes had me almost falling on the floor laughing...such as when Ace gets spears in his legs and the scene where he\\\\\\'s inside a fake rhino! Hardly intellectual faire....but funny. A great film to watch with friends....especially the sort of friends whose favorite DVDs don\\\\\\'t come from the Criterion Collection!\\', \"Well, then god help you. I\\'ve known people who are not big fans of Jim Carey\\'s style of comedy and I can see their point. He\\'s just outrageous and rarely witty. But this movie has a bit of everything: clever dialogues, beautiful locations, and of course Jim Carey at his very best.I find it much funnier than any of his other works. The Mask had too few of the \\'mask\\' scenes, Pet Detective was just about OK, nothing great. This movie though is better because the story flows freely(unlike P.D) and it has a lot of Jim Carey (unlike The Mask). The scene at the monastery is actually brilliantly shot and to have such OTT comedy at what otherwise seems so mystical a location, I\\'ve never seen something like that. And lastly, yes it may seem a bit absurd, it\\'s Ace\\'s love for animals that comes out quite well. To have gone to a seclusion for losing a racoon(he was not paid to find anyways) is both hilarious and heart warming.The rhino scene alone would\\'ve made this one of my favorite comedies, but there\\'s so much more on offer.8/10\", \"One of the best and my favorite comedy movies ever! I have watched it at least 7 times and found it funny each time. All those guys saying this part is not as good as the first one, must be out of their sense of humor! This part lives up to its expectations and i found it even funnier than the first part. You might get bored watching the first part 3 or 4 times but not this part! This is a must see film if you haven\\'t seen it already. I own its DVD and keep it very close to my DVD player all the times...never know when i\\'d like to watch it again :-) I would give it a well deserving 10 out of 10, it cant get any better than this. I really feel sorry for those who didn\\'t find it funny. Please Don\\'t miss it...watch it today!!! Highly recommended!!!!\", \\'I loved this movie ever since in come out in 1995 when i was six years old...I love Jim Carrey am a BIG fan of him...and i think that this was his best performance...he just so funny in this movie...\"It\\\\\\'s the mucus that binds us\" still cracks me up today... His other famous saying \"Ok take care now, by bye then\" and \"alrightly\" are classic lines...Its best to see the first movie \"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\", before you see the second movie so you get the feel of Ace Ventura...the jokes get so much more funnier in the second movie...Just the way Jim acts as Ace is genius...i recommend everyone see this movie...\\']',\n",
              "       '[\\'Popcorn is the word that most describes this action-comedy movie from Joseph Reuben, the man who directed other standard fare like SLEEPING WITH THE ENEMY, TRUE BELIEVER, THE STEPFATHER, DREAMSCAPE, and most recently, a notorious bomb called THE FORGOTTEN.So let\\\\\\'s see how I can dive into this pool without hitting a hard surface. This is a \"buddy-movie\" in which two uber-American guys of very different temperaments and backgrounds share a bond that goes beyond anything they might go through. One of the two is by default a loose cannon and drives the plot with his antics. There may be some tension when a corrupt high official threatens the loose cannon. Add a sexy new co-worker into the mix (which becomes the focus of their intense, male attraction) and basically you have a story that has been of late the norm in the Hollywood popcorn machine.Now, trying to cash in (I believe, I could be wrong) on their previous outing WHITE MEN CAN\\\\\\'T JUMP, Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes play not buddies from the \\\\\\'hood but foster \\\\\\'brothas\\\\\\' (if we can believe this baby) who are closer than a cuticle is to a finger even though Snipes has to act as older brother to a rebellious and unpredictable Harrelson: and on that note, neither is miscast. Snipes does convey steel while Harrelson gives off his just-under-the-surface danger, especially when he grins at smarmy boss Robert Blake in one subway scene.Pitching in for the Latina female is Jennifer Lopez who, without being as angry and nasal and in-your-face as Rosie Perez, actually manages to be engaging though this is early in her career, before she decided to punch out and play her (bland) self once she became the trademark known as J. Lo. She all but steals her own pat scenes, especially in one tense exchange she has with Chris Cooper playing a not-so-nice fellow who pushes people onto subway platforms, a reality among New York strap-hangers.But trying to over-analyze this film in terms of shots and composition and visual technicality would be like trying to compare one grain of popcorn to the next: there would be no difference, no relevance in taste, texture, and all that is left to do is munch down. That the action scenes on the subway platforms (for anyone who is actually acquainted with riding the subways in New York City) are as implausible as ever and only convey the type of hyper-masculinized action that makes superheroes of its actors, but who really cares? It\\\\\\'s fluff, entertaining, mindless, inane, and that\\\\\\'s just what people going to see this type of film expect.\\', \\'So glad I bought this buddy money pot of a buddy cop film! Starring the delightful Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes in a fun banter extravaganza and heist awesomeness! This definitely has its flaws but the pros outweigh everything. Chris Cooper is a great villain and Joseph Ruben directed a nice ballbusting experience! Also Donald Robertson (Robert Blake) was great as the jerk boss cop.\\', \"Reading the reviews below this seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it kind of film. Regardless of whether you \\'get\\' the story and the rapport between Harrelson and Snipes, you can\\'t overlook that this is a well made film.I\\'ve only seen it twice, once when it first came out on video, and again in the past week. I didn\\'t think it was that remarkable when it first came out, but when I watched it the second time around, I found it highly entertaining and well executed.

Bill Nun is great in his cameo (Nunn Rules!). Rest of the cast do fine. Overall a must see!. **** out of 5\", \"After watching this movie I had one question, what was the point? The plot existed but was so thin that they had top fill it up with boring relationship scenes which served no purpose to the movie and a psycho-pyromaniac who gets his thrills from pushing people in the front of trains and burning women in ticket booths.The thin plot is that there are two brothers (whose names I can\\'t remember) and there is the running joke that one is white and one is black, but the joke isn\\'t funny. The white one has incurred a huge gambling debt and needs the money. They work as transit police who seem to have nothing better to do than to set up muggers in subway stations. Personally, I find it quite stupid because I don\\'t think any police force has the resources to pretend to be drunks hoping to catch purse snatchers, and even then there is no point because the penalty is not that high.There is a train which carries all of the revenue from the ticket sales and it is dubbed the money train. This train has priority over all other trains and the controller, Paterson, is quite a mean little rat. The white guy, who owes lots of money, decides that he will steal the money train, and he does so. This is pretty silly because there was only one guard on the train with around three million dollars on it. Honestly, this movie was pretty poor and the struggle of actually building a plot is shown with the existence of a mad man. Personally, don\\'t bother.\", \"Action is an interesting film genre. You go in expecting little and are pleasantly surprised if you get more. Films like Face/Off, Die Hard, Speed, Under Siege, while formulaic, were all able to offer the viewer more than they expected going in and so have become beloved classics of the genre. The Money Train tries to be more than a lot of the action films that came out and simply disappeared in the early 90s, but falls a little short. While the film certainly isn\\'t bad, it isn\\'t considered a classic of the genre, and, while not a financial failure, relatively few people saw it and even fewer remember it.The film reunites the stars of White Men Can\\'t Jump, Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes as a pair of law enforcement officers John (Snipes) and Charlie (Harrelson) who basically decide to steal from their boss (Robert Blake) who is a real piece of work. John has a hot girlfriend Grace (a pre Selena Jennifer Lopez) and Charlie has a gambling problem. Sound familiar? There are some funny moments and the dramatic scenes between Snipes and Harrelson are excellent. But aside from these, there really aren\\'t any memorable moments. While the pairing of Snipes and Harrelson isn\\'t tired, it doesn\\'t have the same impact it had on their previous outing. Blake is menacing and odious but his character is not a believable or effective villain. Chris Cooper, who has a smaller role in this as Torch, would have been a better antagonist.Money Train is OK and a reasonably entertaining way to spend a couple of hours, but it is also a missed opportunity. Snipes, Lopez, Harrelson and Blake try hard, but the finished product is less than the sum of its parts, and that\\'s possibly the most frustrating thing of all.\", \"Two foster brothers work as transit cops. While one\\'s life is as good as it gets, the other\\'s is at an all time low. After losing his job, getting dumped by his brother, and getting seven bells kicked out of him by a loan shark, He implements his plan to steal the titular train. A train carrying the New York Subway\\'s weekly revenue. But when things don\\'t go according to plan, will his brother be able to save him in time....It was inevitable that after the success of White Men can\\'t Jump and Bad Boys, that Hollywood re-team this pair because of the chemistry they had in that 1992 comedy.Make them cops, and you have a sure fire hit on your hands..Well you would if the main focus was on the killer The Torch, played wonderfully by Chris Cooper, rather than Harrelson trying to steal because he\\'s gambled his life away.And this is why the film doesn\\'t work. Harrelson is supposed to come across as a lovable rogue, but he\\'s just a hindrance to everyone and everything, and he comes across as a complete moron.Snipes is the voice of reason, and is the reason to watch this film. He\\'s on top form here, acting wise and action wise, and elevates the film whenever he\\'s on screen.The film has a very nasty racist streak down it, in the form of Robert Blake\\'s abhorrent pantomime villain. The only thing that\\'s missing from his outfit is a white hood, the script is so blunt with it\\'s casual racism, it ruins the flow of the film.The ending borrows from Speed, and although it\\'s set at Christmas, it\\'s about as festive as the hangover after new year\\'s day.But it\\'s not boring, Lopez makes a good supporting character, and the afterthought of The Torch sub-plot is the most interesting part of the film.If this was the primary part of the narrative, it could have been quite a good comedy thriller.Instead, the film wants you to root for a gambling loser who thinks that the world owes him something.\", \"I am not a huge fan of thrillers, but once in a while there are some that surprise me. I just prefer thrillers that aren\\'t that violent or gory and I had low expectations for \\'\\'Money Train\\'\\'. Thankfully, I was wrong. While the movie is far from a must-see, it was an ok and enjoyable time-passer.The leads (played by Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes) are two foster brothers that work as transit cops. While Snipes\\' character has a good life, Harrelson\\'s life is a mess. Then, as a sort of personal revenge, he decides to steal the money train (that carries the New York subway\\'s workers\\' salaries). But when something goes wrong will his brother save him? See the film.The bottom line is that the movie is fun. Along with the two leads also Jennifer Lopez (in one of her first movies and one of her best) and veteran Robert Blake (few years before he retired) give nice support. The actors\\' performances are ok and the story is not great, but decent.\", \"The movie doesn\\'t have much of a plot but it\\'s still a pretty entertaining movie. Which features great performances from the cast. It\\'s nice for a Saturday night at the movies.3(***)out of 4(****)stars\"]'],\n",
